"I'll be as brief as possible.  My wife is pregnant (only a few months).  Her mother smokes.  My wife today made a reference to using her parents as free/cheap child care in the future.  I said there is no way I will allow our child into their ashtray of a house (MIL smokes IN the house).  She doesn't even smoke outside when company comes over (as briefly as possible due to aforementioned smoke) for holidays.  This means the house reeks and is smokey all the time.  Therefore MIL and her car also always smell of smoke so even if she came to my house I would still be very uncomfortable with the idea of her touching and being close to the baby.  

My wife seemed offended that I don't want our child exposed to cigarette smoke and made some snide remark about my parents being too far away before storming off.  My parents live a few hours away but would certainly come by to help a few weeks a year as needed so I don't understand why my wife would be upset with them.  They are very nice, don't smoke, and would offer to help however possible.",0,Male,original
"A couple of weekends ago I moved in with my boyfriend of 3 years. It's not been the best 3 years for me, weight wise. There was the stress of unemployment, and then the stress of a job, before that there was the stress of school and I comfort ate my way through all of it. Unfortunately, those bad eating habits have become my norm and I struggle to fix it.

&#x200B;

Any way, so, we get done moving in, the last of the stuff is put away, I'm so excited that I hug him, he hugs me back, lifts me up, but not far, I hear and "" oof"" he puts me down and says, "" **We may need to christen this apartment with a diet plan**"" then he smirks and chuckles, as if he's held onto that comment for months just waiting to unleash it. I asked him what he meant. When he saw I wasn't amused, he tried to backpedal and say he was kidding, that I'm sexy and perfect.  When the backpedal didn't work, he then tried to go 50% "" Oh its a joke calm down"" while also going 50% "" It's not untrue what I'm saying"". Its made the start of living together very rough.

"Hi! I’m 20F& my bf 23M &we’re in a argument right now bc he gave this necklace to his friend to give to his gf. We’ve been dating for almost 4 years&we live together.So let me explain the situation. 

My boyfriend works as a porter in buildings&sometimes he gets free packages bc they never get picked up.Today he called me& &he was talking about how our friend (Riley) passed by his job today.Our friend Riley got his girl flowers&other items for their anniversary.I was like aw that’s so cute&sweet.They made 2 months.I hung up on him saying bye bc I was eating&watching tv.

An hour later, he calls me again asking me “If I got you a necklace would you wear it?” I said OC, I love small gifts.he was like “well too late, you should’ve told me before bc I gave it to Riley to give to Jessica (his gf).” I was confused bc there was no reason to ask me if I wanted the necklace if he already gave it to Riley. He never asked me before hand if I wanted it. It got me a lil irritated bc he kept talking about it&I felt like he was flaunting it. I told him that I was annoyed. Than I was like okay I gtg bye. I didn’t have to go but I didn’t want to talk anymore cuz I was frankly a little jealous. I text him right away how I feel. I didn’t tell him otp cuz I didn’t want to give him attitude on accident. 

After telling him,he was like bro talk to your game you’re in a “bitchy” mood.He sent me a picture of the necklace &said “it was small & it was from Etsy.”He was trying to tell me “look it’s cheap & small you wouldn’t have liked it”  but I actually liked it a lot which got me even more irritated cuz I knew I was going to have to see Jessica wear the necklace knowing I would’ve gotten it. Also it’s kinda messed up to Jessica because Riley basically got her a hand me down necklace as a gift. It was a fake silver necklace with a pendant. It would’ve matched perfectly with the necklace from my uncle that passed away which is also silver. My boyfriend bought me a necklace before that’s gold and he gets mad that I don’t wear it but I don’t wear it cuz it doesn’t match the necklace from my uncles death. But the silver necklace he got today wouldve matched perfectly.

After explaining my feelings to my bf he was being mean abt it saying I was taking it the wrong way&that I’m exaggerating&to leave him alone& he wont talk to me. He was super mad that I hung up&now instead of listening to me abt my feelings&how it kinda hurt ,he says he’s very angry about the hang up& he doesn’t care. 

I called him&he didn’t pick up;he’s being petty bc I hung up. Now he doesn’t wanna talk to me, he’s ignoring my text/calls&keeps giving me attitude saying he doesn’t care&I took it the wrong way. 

I’m not even that mad abt the necklace anymore bc what’s done is done.I’m angry tht he was fighting with me abt how I hung up &now trying to turn this situation on me.

So, am i the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend for giving the necklace to his friend to give to his girlfriend?

Edit: My boyfriend got home and we talked. It was a misunderstanding. He genuinely wanted to know if I would want a necklace but he didn’t want to give me a hand me down. He says he never said he had the necklace on him and didn’t mean to make it seem like that because he already gave it to our friend. I wish he told me at the beginning instead of ignoring me because I hung up. However, I acknowledge I’m wrong for hanging up the first time.",0,Female,original
"So I (23M) have a girlfriend(22F) and she has a good friend and he’s aromantic-asexual. They are in a Queer-Platonic Relationship, and they’re pretty much just like friends they just spend more time together and are a little more intimate. When she told me, I was totally fine with it. But now, I’ve started getting a little jealous. They are really close, and I start to get the feeling their more than friends. She says her friend is romance/sex repulsed but I’m starting to get the feeling their lying to me. We have plenty of private dates, but also sometimes my gf will get us to all go out together, and I feel like he’s just a third wheel, and just seeing them together makes me feel like I need to protect her. I’ve been holding back until yesterday when she invited him to have dinner with us. They were talking and laughing and I lost my nerve. I got angry and left the table, gf came to ask me what was wrong, and I snapped. I told her I was sick of her lying to me and cheating in front of my face. She asked what I meant and I told her I was talking about him. She looked confused and explained to me again the whole situation, but I didn’t want to hear it. Then he came into the room and asked what was going on, and I cursed him out. Then I stormed out. I haven’t talked to her since and I really don’t feel that bad for what I did, but I want to get a third party’s opinion, so here I am.

So, AITA for being jealous and yelling at my girlfriend because of her Queer Platonic Relationship?",1,Male,original
"So I work at a restaurant. It’s not uncommon that some glass may break in a garbage can. Should have gone into a glass bucket but things happen. Young girl cut her leg on her shin by her ankle pretty bad and was freaking out. Dishwasher tried to hand her a bandaid and she came out of the kitchen and asked me for help. 

For context my girlfriend is a nurse. She cut her leg in a pretty similar way a few months ago and I remembered what she did and I helped the girl clean it and bandage it while we waited for her mom. 

Mom got there and thanked me and took her home. 

I told my girlfriend about this scenario thinking that she would be proud of me for helping and knowing how to handle the situation. Instead she is irate, telling me that I did way too much for this girl who probably thinks I was flirting (???) saying I don’t know how teenagers think and I made her look like a dumbass. 

I told her I was sorry for making her feel uncomfortable? Since I didn’t wanna tell her she was wrong for feeling a certain way but that she’s making it seem like I somehow disrespected our relationship and that wasn’t fair. She’s fuming and isn’t responding to my texts. I’m just so mind boggled as to how I did anything wrong. She said I was completely inappropriate and young girls are impressionable and I want to be everyone’s hero and I want to be liked. When all I did was try to help a young girl who got hurt.

"I found out my ex girlfriend was on tinder because she was lonely while I worked overtime so I promptly broke up with her. I paid like 80% of all our expenses since she was finishing school and did serving part time while trying to build a clientele for her art stuff on the side. Anyways, I bought her an iPad to sketch with and a MacBook Pro because her laptop like 5 years old and so slow. Once we broke up, I decided to just let her stay in the apartment for the remaining two months we had before our lease was up. I insisted we split 50/50 but she couldn’t afford it so I ended up still having to pay most of the rent these last two months even though I moved to my new condo. 

I felt the whole thing was pretty unfair and when she was out with her friends on some girls night out I went in and took back the gifts I got her.  She blew up my phone the next day and said she needed the laptop for her classes and the iPad for her Etsy digital art stuff but I said it really wasn’t my problem and blocked her. I wiped the devices and have all the receipts and she’s always broke so I didn’t really take her civil court threat seriously for stealing “her stuff.”  We share the same friend group unfortunately but most of the guys said I did the right thing. A couple of her close friends keep trying to confront me at parties and trying to get me to give the stuff back. AITA

Edit: We’re both on the lease so I couldn’t kick her out.

Edit: My ex would literally just not pay the rent had I forced her to pay 50% and it would just look bad on my rent history. To some of the posters saying I’m going to get sued by her regardless.

"My(28M) mother hosts these dinners where she usually wears traditional/cultural clothes, cooks the traditional/cultural foods etc.  She wears traditional clothes because my dad loved seeing her dressed in them because he thought she looked beautiful in those clothes

We can wear what we want.  However, since the dinners are usually done in a traditional/cultural setting, all the guests wear something culturally appropriate.

My wife(24F) however doesn't like wearing the culturally appropriate clothes and tells me its rude for my mom to host such dinners where people might feel uncomfortable. 

I told her it isn't even compulsory for anyone at the dinner to wear culturally appropriate clothes, most guests wear it because they see it as a fun theme for a dinner. My mom is completely fine with guests wearing even a garbage bag to the dinner(not literally.... Haha). 

I told her to wear what she likes and come to the dinner. She said she also feels excluded when she's the only one to not be wearing culturally appropriate clothes. So I told her that's fine and she can stay at home and my mom wouldn't feel offended or anything. I would go there, meet my mom, have dinner and come back as soon as possible. 

She's mad at me now. 

AITA? 

Edit 1: my family is Polish. We live in the US but my mom likes to host these dinners as she misses her childhood home. 
My wife spent her childhood in Alaska. She's not Polish. 

Edit 2: this dinner usually takes place on my dad's death anniversary as a way to remember him. My mom is usually very sad on this day so I go to comfort her. 

Edit 3: after my father's death when I was 3 months old my mom never remarried because she wasn't able to get past his death. He died in a truck accident. He was walking and a drunk truck driver collided with him

About my mom, she said that her relatives usually asked her to be more ladylike all the time and she has a bad experience with other people telling her to cook. When my mom sent her recipes, she felt like the cycle was repeating. 
I told her that her behaviour towards my mom was still very much unacceptable. However, we agreed to let her leave my mom's home for a while to get head space whenever she felt overwhelmed.

"My job has been short staffed for months and everyone's been having to work longer hours to cover for the lack of people. I recently had caught covid and quarantined before going back to work.

Today I called out of work because I was so exhausted from working 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m back to back. my job wanted me to come back in for my regular shift at 2:00 to 10:00 p.m. My girlfriend had called before she came home around 1:00pm and I told her over the phone that I called out of work and needed to sleep because I was extremely exhausted. When she comes home at around 2:00pm she immediately tries to wake me up, telling me that I need to get up or I won't be able to sleep at night. I told her again "" please I just need to sleep I'm exhausted"". She leaves the bedroom and comes back with brand new pillows that are in loud plastic bags and begins to plop them on the bed. She starts to open the closet and rummage things around not quietly at all. At this point I was getting slightly irritated but was too exhausted to really say anything. My girlfriend leaves the room with the bedroom door open. She's still being loud. Opening things loudly talking loudly ect....

She immediately goes ""no you need to get up"". At this point I completely lost my composure.

"* **Proposal:** Burping should be treated like farting: do so as quietly as possible when around other people. 

* **Counter-Argument:** ""*Bbbbuuuurrrrrpppp*, Pickle Rickkkkk!""

So in all seriousness, at the beginning of our relationship, I voiced my opinion on loud burping, and ever since she has politely stifled her burps. Fast forward a few years later, and she has suddenly begun letting them absolutely rip while we're in our bedroom together. She's been having a tough few weeks at work, so I refrained from saying anything until six-o-clock this morning when she let loose a particularly loud one. It was one of those long, deep-pitched bangers of a belch for which your middle school friends would have heartily applauded. 

Tired and annoyed, I asked: ""Is there any particular reason for your recent change in opinion on burping?"" 

She immediately became defensive, and angrily stated she didn't think it was healthy to hold them in. I said I wasn't asking her to. I'm just asking her not to purposely burp *loudly* while I'm around. She passive-aggressively replied ""I'll work on it"" and promptly walked out of the room. 

I get that there are cultural differences and that some groups of adults have no problem with loud belching around each other. I also personally enjoy letting one rip when I'm home alone and no one will be bothered by it. However, when I'm around other people I always stifle my burps as much as possible. It's just the polite thing to do, right?

**TLDR: Is it unreasonable to ask my girlfriend to avoid deliberately belching loudly around me?**

----------------

**Edit: Do people genuinely find it hard to burp quietly?** 

It seems like this is the crux of some disagreement here. I was under the impression that it's just as easy (or easier) to burp quietly as it is to belch loudly. You just keep your mouth closed and let it out slowly through your nose. If people actually don't know how to do this or find it difficult, then I think I understand all of the YTA votes.",0,Male,original
"My [22M] girl friend [23F] isn't the cleanest person. Every morning she makes herself breakfast and goes to work without cleaning anything up. I work from home so usually end up cleaning it in my down time as I don't like having a messy kitchen. This usually includes putting the food she took away, washing her dishes and putting them in the dish washer, and either hand washing pots and pans or putting them in the sink to soak (no issues with lettings pots and pans soak as they take a little more time to clean than just putting stuff in the dish washer or back in the fridge). 


This happens almost every morning. I've tried to tell her before to put stuff away, but she always gets mad and tells me she doesn't have time and needs to get to work, and that she will do it when she gets home. I somewhat understand as she has ADHD and poor time management skills, but it still gets on my nerve, especially when she leaves food open and out.  I've tried to tell her to wake up earlier then but she does the thing where she has 5 alarms, 2-3 of them going off before she gets up.

This morning as she was about to leave I asked if she could clean up her breakfast time. She blew up at me saying she didn't have the time, and was very aggressively cleaning up. All in all it took around 2 minutes, which I pointed out (probably not the best idea), and she left visibly angry.

I feel bad for getting her into a bad mood before work, but it is really starting to get on my nerves always having to clean up after her. I feel like it's inconsiderate to expect me to cleanup after you because I want the kitchen to be somewhat clean looking and not have food / dishes strewn around every where. It unsettles me to have a super messy kitchen, and can make cooking my own meals at home a pain since there's stuff everywhere or the sink is piled high with her dishes (when we have an empty dish washer...). 

So, AITA? I want to find a way to tell her how I feel about cleaning up after her, but she always goes on the defensive and says she doesn't have time and her ADHD makes it hard.


Edit: Just herself, I usually make breakfast later when she's gone and always clean up after myself (and then usually her too as her stuffs in the way or it makes me uncomfortable sitting out).

We usually have dinner together, most of the times I do the cooking (which is usually on my end, out kitchen isn't super big so two people gets really tight.  She'll help when I ask). I usually end up doing most of the cleaning of the pots and pans, she *usually* puts her dishes away then but sometimes forgets.",0,Male,original

"Last week my fiancée had an appointment at a bridal store. Since her friends are all over the country for work or school and also because of pandemic protocols the appointment had to stay small so only her parents and sister went with her. My fiancée got home from the appointment in tears. She said when they got to the bridal store her sister was looking at dresses instead of paying attention to the appointment and then their parents especially their mother started looking with her and she started trying on dresses herself and then her parents bought her sister a dress. Her sister is single. Not engaged. The appointment was supposed to be for my fiancée but her sister took over and my fiancée didn't even get to try on a single dress. When we announced our engagement her parents said they couldn't help us with the wedding but we didn't ask or even expect them to. The dress they bought her sister was more then what our budget was for my fiancée's dress. And her sister isn't engaged or even in a relationship. Her parents called me a few hours later to 'warn' me my wife got emotional and dramatic at the appointment. I told them that both of them and her sister were no longer invited to the wedding because of their actions.

Normally I wouldn't interfere with my fiancée's family and if my she wanted to overrule me I would 100% support her but she was so upset when she got home from the appointment I felt I had to do something. It's been almost a week and my fiancée is ignoring her parents and sister's calls and texts and she hasn't said anything about re-inviting them even after I let her know it's up to her and I support her decision. Her parents and sister have been leaving me voicemails and texts saying I'm controlling, out of line, it's none of my business and they also accuse my fiancée of being emotional, overreacting and being mean to her sister and killing her fun. My fiancée is the least selfish person I have ever met and I don't think she's wrong for being upset at what happened at the appointment. My fiancée graduated medical school in 2019 and began a residency in internal medicine at a hospital in June 2019. We all know about the pandemic that hit less then a year later, it has been very hard, fraught and emotional for my fiancee and her colleagues. I don't know how they do it. Some days she cries a lot. My fiancée doesn't ask for much and while we are not having a big or expensive wedding come hell or high water I'm making sure she gets to be happy. I am furious at her parents and sister. They are my fiancée's only family and they should be supporting her. Was I wrong to uninvite them when I found out what happened? Does it make me the asshole if I did it without consulting my fiancée? Thank you for your input in my situation.

"Actually, this is more a would I be the AH as I haven’t done anything yet. My husband took a buyout from a job he worked at for 26 years about 5 years ago. He has been struggling, bouncing around from job to job ever since, each situation worst than the last. We have a decent IRA and investments but he wants to work a few more years until our daughter finishes college. Right before Covid hit and everything shut down, an old manager reached out to him and asked if he wanted his old job back. We ran into a different manager at a party this summer who basically said in not so many words, that he could come back if he wanted to. He says he wouldn’t because he felt he was treated badly his last year there, that they couldn’t wait to get him out. He also said it’s a different industry than it was when he started and it would be more difficult to make a living. But he hasn’t made a living in the last 5 years. Even though a lot of the managers he knew have left and the company has been sold to a different owner, he still would know people who would look out for him and let him get up to speed, where it seems these days most companies expect you to be able to hit the ground running your first week. An old manager is a connection of mine on LinkedIn and this is someone he still keeps in contact with. I have seen open postings of jobs that he could do. I am thinking of going against his wishes, sending a message to the manager with the links to these postings, and telling the manager that he “never heard from me.” I am getting desperate and frustrated and all other options are exhausted.

"I honestly can’t believe I’m posting this but here we go…

So, my ex gives me a generous amount of child support every month and I use about 20-30% of it maybe. I’m very good at budgeting since my mum raised me on her own and we always stuck to a strict budget. My ex grew up being overindulged and knowing he would never have to worry about money in his lifetime, so we have different ideas of what living cheaply looks like.

Recently my ex wanted to have a word with me because he didn’t like the fact that I made our son walk home from school. He wanted to know why I wouldn’t buy a car and offered me money to get one when I told him cars were expensive and I thought it was a waste of money. I told him no since I would rarely use it. He then told me to take an uber home instead of making him walk. Again, I told him no and he brought up all of the other ways he thought I was making our son “live cheaply”. For example: I didn’t buy him new football boots or a goal when he started getting into football (he is only 4), I buy him “cheap” clothes, I rarely take him to eat out and if we go to a toy shop, I only ever let him get one thing and it can’t be super expensive.

My ex wanted to know what I was using all of the money he gave to me on if I was raising our son like this, so I explained I never used most of it but kept it in a separate account for either a rainy day or for our son. Now he’s angry at me for making our son “live cheaply” and essentially told me to stop saving and actually give our son the things he wants now because he had already made sure our son would be fine in the future.

AITA?

Edit: I was trying to avoid editing the post but since so many people are asking me to/asking me the same question over and over again...

Of course my **FOUR YEAR OLD** son doesn't walk home alone from school. I drop him off and then pick him up. The teacher only lets him leave the building after she sees me. Also, it's a 25 minute walk for anyone who cares.

"On mobile, apologizing for any format bugs.

So, backstory: I have an ex-girlfriend that I’m seeing again. We split amicably, and we both had some issues we were working on, so it was mutual. 

One thing about her is she is in the military, and there’s this guy that we both know. They’re good friends, and I’d say I’m very distant/old friends with the guy. Two years ago she was deployed, and during the time I had a plethora of friends who kept insisting that I meet other girls/I should cheat on her. This guy, T, was the most aggressive one. He constantly accused me of dating other girls, kept harassing me every time I wasn’t at home studying or working because he thought I’d be with a different girl, and even tried pushing one of his single friends onto me at a bar. There’s a handful of other things he pulled, but I think you all get the gist. 

She is aware of the fact that he did this at the time and that I do not contact anyone who made my life miserable when she was gone. However, she asked me to spend time with him and a couple of his friends this weekend so I don’t know if she remembers this. He is a very good friend to her, but I haven’t spoken to him since then and I cannot forgive what he did to me. I do not mind that she has the friendship she has, and I will not control her or tell her how to feel, however, I do not have anything nice to say about him. I feel like I may be holding a grudge and I’m not being very supportive, but I also feel like this is me sacrificing a boundary if I say “yes.”

"I know I’m off to a rough start based due to the title, but I do genuinely want some unbiased perspective as my friends and family seem to be on my side. 

Here is the story: 

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now (both 25). We both live alone in separate apartments as I don’t want to live with someone that I am not at least engaged to and he agrees. 
Obviously, we spend 90% of our time with one another at one of our apartments (drawer for me at his place and vice versa). we usually only separate for a day or two when our schedules don’t align. 

He has recently adopted a cat, and I have multiple issues with this. 

First, I have been telling him since we first met that I don’t think getting a cat is a good idea. At first, I was just speaking for myself, but have more recently made it be known that i wouldnt like it if HE got a cat either. He would always say he understood but he loves cats! It was never anything too serious until recently. He did get the cat without me knowing.

Second, and least important, is my dog. My dog has pretty severe anxiety issues, and the only two people she trusts are my bf and I. technically, she is my dog (adopted before our relationship/I pay the vet bills), but we refer to her as OUR dog as she has a home with both of us. Her anxiety isn’t aggressive, but she will simply sit in a corner and shake when other animals are around. She usually just wants to be left alone and cats are pretty good at doing that, so im not worried about safety more than comfort. 

Finally, WE ARE BOTH ALLERGIC TO CATS! His allergies are more severe than mine, and I attribute that to the fact that his family all have several in their homes so he gets more exposure. Not only have I told him I don’t want the extra monthly cost of buying medication, but I have also told him how exposure can make allergies worse and I don’t want that for either of us! 

Now the cat is here, to my surprise. Yes, limiting our time to my apartment alone is a solution, but one I only see as temporary. We have talked about marriage and buying a home together, and after this long in the relationship I was hoping to consider it more seriously. I don’t want to live with a cat. He has always known this. I am feeling a little lied to and tricked now, and told him I hope he considers not keeping it as I don’t know where I stand if he does. In my mind, it’s best to ask this of him now rather than later after he has gotten time to grow a tight bond with it. Its clear he thinks Im being a cat hating cold person, AITA?",1,Female,original
"TL/DR: Jointly owned vacation house is being claimed by my husband's ex.  WIBTA for pushing him to resolve the dispute legally?

Many years ago, my husband (55M) and his then-wife (58F) bought a vacation house.  They used to spend time up there with their kids, especially certain holidays, and have lots of memories associated with the house.  My husband's wife divorced him about ten years ago, but he would still go to the house with them and it was still like they were together, they just weren't sleeping together.  The vacation house remained joint property in the legal split.  My husband still pays half of the property taxes and insurance.

Seven years ago, I (50F) started dating my husband, we married five years ago.  I am also divorced and  have kids.  The two of us would go to the vacation house occasionally.  At some point, the ex had a meltdown because the house was ""her sanctuary"" and she didn't want me there in her special place.  We think that her kids got wind of this and told her that was uncool, because she called back later and said it was okay for us to go.

Due to obligations with family in town, we haven't been able to go to the house in over a year and we thought it would be lovely to get away for the weekend.  My husband called his ex to see if she was planning on being there, and she went off about how we couldn't go because she had just had a maid come clean everything, and we just couldn't go.  She called again while we were at National Night Out and left a weepy message about how we couldn't go because it was HER house and she didn't want me there in HER kitchen, and sleeping with my husband in HER bed.  She would repay my husband for the taxes and insurance, and then the house would be hers. (side note - ex is a lawyer)

My husband avoids conflict like the plague, so he didn't call back because he doesn't like to argue with her, mostly because she comes up with these irrational reasons for things that you just can't argue with.  We spent the weekend at a friend's place.

I would like my husband to talk with a lawyer about the options, and then tell the ex that either she buys his half of the house (not just pay back taxes and insurance) from him or we get free access to the house and she can't complain.  We'll also need to tell his kids about this because his ex will make up some story about how we're money grubbing assholes.  They know she can be awful, and I'd like to get through this as calmly as possible.

I know my husband hates conflict, and he especially hates conflict with his ex so, WIBTA for pushing him to deal with his ex in the vacation house sharing drama, which will be rife with stress and conflict?",0,Female,original
"My boyfriend and I are currently living with his parents, we have been for the last 8 months. Our state has been in lockdown for the last 5 months so we have been home 24/7. We are moving states and into our own place when travel restrictions ease (probably not until early next year) , his parents are moving to the same state and plan to buy a new home.Lockdown has eased and we are now allowed to travel within our state and its our 5th year anniversary coming up. We decided to go away for the weekend and my boyfriend is taking a day off work. He warned me that his mother would lose her temper when she finds out we are going away on the weekend because for the last 4-5 months we have been doing house work for her and helping them prep their house to sell (which in my opinion they should wait until we CAN actually move states but their plan is to sell anyway and then rent somewhere or live in a caravan and hire a storage unit until restrictions ease)Just like he predicted, yesterday he told her that we were going away for the weekend and she lost it, she started listing all the things he needed to do before we were ""allowed"" to go away. She mentioned how stupid it was that he was taking a day off work because he's not earning money (she thinks he is stupid with his money and constantly argues with him about it)He does have an issue with saving money, but he's been transferring money into my account so that he can't have access to it and that seems to work.We were about to go out for the day but she said ""well since you're going away next weekend work starts now"" and listed everything she wanted done. before we were allowed to go out together for lunch. It took so long to do what she wanted that we only had an hour out together before everything closed. Just before we left I had to hang our washing out and I was outside, I was in a very angry mood because of everything that had just happened and she walked outside to help me.She walked out saying ""AH one day I'll get through to him"". and she then said ""maybe you'll get through to him one day?"" and I said ""probably not"". and she repeated what I said. She then said ""One day you'll understand when you have children, you just worry thats all. How is he ever going to afford an engagement ring"". and I bluntly said ""he probably will never buy one"". (I was in a very cynical over it mood and afterwards I felt bad for being so blunt) We left and went to a donut shop for a coffee and just sat there happy to be away from the house for a while. We came back and he told her where we went and she said ""wow, wheres my donut?"" then told him he shouldn't eat anything from the cupboards anymore if he's going to be so selfish not to think of her next time.

"It’s my [27F] birthday tomorrow and I was wanting my boyfriend [27M] to stay home and spend the day with me for it. 

He works Monday - Saturday except he gets every Thursday off. My birthday happens to fall on a Wednesday, so I was hoping he could have both days off so we could do something together for my birthday (I’m a SAHM and don’t work as of yet). 

He originally told me (on Sunday) that he won’t be able to take the day off, as we need money, and that he would just spend the day with me Thursday like he usually does. 

I was fine with this, however, come Monday I find that he wasn’t getting ready for work in the morning as I was getting our children ready for school. I asked him how come he hadn’t gotten dressed yet and he responded saying he wasn’t going in to work today. I asked him if he was feeling well and he said he was and that he “just didn’t feel like going”. 

The exact same thing happened today. Woke up, he wasn’t ready, wasn’t going to get ready and didn’t feel like going to work. 

Tonight I asked him “are you going to work tomorrow?” to which he told me that he hadn’t thought about it yet and that he should really go in because we do need the money, and it’s not fair to have every day off but Friday. 

I was extremely upset by this response, and went quiet. He said “what? So you want me to stay home and if I don’t you’ll hate me? Is that it? I already told you we need the money, and you know we need it, so what’s the problem?” 

I’m having a really hard time feeling like I’m being the bad guy here, because I know we do need money to live when he’s the only one working, but I don’t think it’s fair for him to say he can’t stay home, then stay home and get mad at me when I ask for one more day off. AITA???",0,Female,original
"I apologize in advance, I’m on mobile. 

To make a long story short, about six months ago I got out of a very turbulent, toxic relationship with my ex. We had a mutual agreement that I would continue to pay for my car and insurance (which was financed under his name) for the remainder of the loan. Due to my financial circumstances (which I’m acting improving), I am not able to transfer this car into my name after our break up which is why we came to the aforementioned agreement. We don’t communicate regularly, I simply just transfer the money to his bank account every month. I’ve never been late on either payment, typically paying about 10 days early. 

This week, he got word that I was in a new relationship and made a point to contact my partner. He sent him loads of old screenshots from when we first broke up, trying to make it seem like we were still in communication. He also tried to file a protective order saying that we are harassing him. This is not true, all communications between the three of us have happened because he initiated communication. My current partner saw through his tactic and our relationship was not affected. However, now I’m at a point where I do not want to have any ties to this person. Legally, I don’t believe I have any obligation as this car loan is not in my name. Even though I agreed to pay it, I don’t think that he has authorization to require payments of anyone. I could be wrong, however.

This is my issue, morally (and it could be because of the years of emotional manipulation). If I return this vehicle to him, I know there’s no way he’s going to be able to pay it and his rent. He will either be evicted or have a repossession under his name. While I want nothing to do with this person, I also don’t want to hurt someone financially. I don’t need the car. I travel for work 90% of the time, so I drive it maybe three times a month. At this point, he also has his family contacting me trying to persuade me to keep the vehicle. 

So, friends, WIBTA if I took this car back to his apartment and stopped all communication and future payments?

Thanks in advance for your insight!",0,Female,original
"Background- I am female, married to my second husband who is 11 years older than me.

I discovered video games in 2020 during COVID as a way to relax, have some time to myself and connect with my teens.  I work full-time, (remotely during the pandemic).   I prefer games to TV.  My husband loves TV.

I love and support my husband in every way .  When he played hockey every Sunday, all afternoon, I supported him.  When he wants to go camping with his friends during the work week, I support him and tell him to ‘have fun’.  I spend the majority of my non-working time with him.  

But when the tables are turned and I want to have Saturday nights to myself to play games, which is my relaxing alone time, he hassles me, guilts me, and passive-aggressively mocks me.   I even tried streaming and really enjoyed it but chose to quit because he was jealous and didn’t want me streaming and ‘talking to guys’ who visit my stream.  I am faithful, and he could watch my stream or the VOD if he wanted to be sure how I was behaving on stream. I have nothing to hide.  I can give up streaming, but I don’t want to give up playing games altogether.

We have a fun and romantic date night every Friday night.  I usually spend most of the day on  Saturday with him.  I wait until 8-9 pm to game so we can have a full day together.   

I am feeling resentful that I support him in his hobbies and interests, yet he belittles me with  the one thing I am enjoying right now that is for ‘me’, outside of my work and spending time with him.  I’ve told him this, and told him I don’t think it’s fair the way he is treating me, but it hasn’t made a difference.

He won’t play games with me either, it’s just not his thing.  But if he wanted to play with me I would! 

Am I the asshole for gaming Saturday nights, even though he disapproves?",0,Female,original
"I (21F) was in a situationship with John (fake name 25M) about 3 years ago. We went on a couple of dates and were “seeing” each other exclusively for 6 months. I kept asking him what we were (I was naive at 18) and he kept telling me we were “chilling” (I know I know). I eventually got some sense and walked away telling him that I was looking for more than a hookup relationship. All of a sudden he was trying so hard to be part of my life and I settled with being friends. 

Fast forward 3 years and a group of us (my friends and his) were hanging out. He suddenly gets up and asks me “Hey OP I have a surprise for you” I kid you not his friends pull out a poster with “Will you go out with me?” written on it. I froze and sat there for a second before asking him if we could talk privately. I really wish I was exaggerating this situation because this is all I dreamed about 3 years ago. I basically told him that I wasn’t interested anymore and why did it take him 3 years to ask me out? He got upset and basically said he “wasn’t ready at the time but now he was”. I rejected his proposal and left my friends also left with me noting how weird it was. I ran into his best friend who was there and he basically said I was a big asshole for doing that. He said he changed and wanted to start a life with me and how I embarrassed him when he put so much thought into it. So AITA?

Edit: I pulled him aside PRIVATELY and rejected him NOT in front of everyone. He ran back and told his friends I rejected him as i and my friends were leaving",0,Female,original
"My girlfriend (30f) and I (26f) been dating for two years and live together. Her mom asked to take her out for dinner for her birthday. I am invited but I always pay for myself when we get together with her mother. Her mother would be paying for her. I let my girlfriend know that I would only be able to come if it had options under $20. She got incredibly upset with me and it turned into her yelling at me telling me I was embarrassing her. 

For context, I make half of what she makes yearly. I just celebrated her birthday with her and took her out to a fairly nice restaurant. Of course I paid and treated her to not only that but gifts amounting in close to $400. It’s her 30th birthday, a big deal. We’ve also recently gone out with her friends to expensive restaurants that have totaled quite a bit of money. After all of this, I’m a little uncomfortable with the rate that we are spending money and have expressed discomfort. I am fine going out and budgeted for her birthday, but it feels like there is just event after event that is requiring money. Since I know her mom will only be paying for her, and last year she requested a very expensive restaurant I respectfully let her know that I would only be able to come if there were some entree options for less than $20. I also told her it was totally fine if she wanted a nicer restaurant, I just wouldn’t be able to go but was absolutely OK with that. 

Am I being unfair or embarrassing her by letting her know that I may not be able to go and telling her what I can reasonably afford right now? Especially since we have been out a lot lately? I have savings but going out this much feels excessive and spending $50 on a dinner is way out of my budget given everything I have spent recently on her birthday. Does this come off as cheap or is a reflection on her? AITA?

Edit 1: She let me know that she would be embarrassed by me if I only got the cheapest thing on the menu or a salad.

Edit 2: I meant a restaurant that had entree options for $20 or under. Obviously tax and tip would make it more once the meal was done, this was considered as part of why I chose $20 for the item itself. In my city (in the u.s.) it’s not unreasonable to find a restaurant that has a menu priced with options for under $20, in fact the restaurants where an entree is $25-$40 are considered nicer.",0,Female,original
" 

throwaway because I haven't told him.

context: dated for 4 years, he left me when our daughter was 2 years old. Never formally had a CO in place but lawyers determined he should pay $1120 in child support monthly. I took pity on him and allowed a payment of $800. His second child with new wife came along, told me he could only pay $500. Third child with new wife came along, told me he could only pay $300. Fourth child with new wife came along. Can only pay $150. Fifth child on the way and I haven't received a message about this yet, but I know a decrease is coming. I know he makes a lot more money now because they bought a bigger house recently and a cabin two years ago. Meanwhile I live in a two bedroom apartment and have to ask my parents for help to pay for my daughters sports.

I did bring up that I would really appreciate he pay for half of our daughters dance or at least buy her outfits and he and his wife absolutely lost it on me and gave me a story about how their children don't get to be in sports because they can't afford it???

I don't think its fair that my daughter, his first child has to go without a lot of the time because they keep having kids but he is making me feel really awful about it. I have a meeting with a lawyer in two weeks and I am going to be asking for child support. Am I the asshole?",0,Female,original
"Heading into this post, I know what I did could have came off rude and disrespectful & I totally accept that but I’m on the fence about if I was a total a-hole. 

Me (m24) and my gf (f30) were sitting at the laundromat while her clothes dried. We went and sat in my truck while we waited. She she suggested that we play never have I ever & I agreed because it sounded like fun.  As we began, I put my airpod in my ear farthest and resumed a playlist on the lowest volume for what would essentially be background noise.  

Note: I am sometimes uneasy with silence in the background. It’s weird and I don’t know why but I always have it in my ear for that reason. 

When that happened, she got very upset with me stating that I essentially called her boring and later said that I insulted her presence. I have apologized multiple times and explained all of this and acknowledged how that could have came across as disrespectful and promised to be mindful of those types of things in the future. 

Looking back, I know I shouldn’t have put it in, but even though it was an honest mistake and nothing malicious, was I the a-hole?

"On September 26th, my best friend of 14 years died. It’s already a tough experience, but this is the first person in my life to pass away and so I’m having a really difficult time with it. My boyfriend has let me stay at his house everyday since it’s happened. I spent the first week just crying and asking to just sit with him and cry, even when he was playing video games. That’s all I asked of him.  I’ve now got to the point where I feel guilt for enjoying anything. Laughing makes me feel so shitty cause I just miss my friend so much and he can’t do those things anymore and it feels wrong that I can. Functioning during the day is honestly draining me cause I just want to cry but I hold it in all day til I get home and today was just super hard for me and I just needed my boyfriend. He works nights so when I got off at 5 I went to his house and laid beside him until he got up. When he woke up, he went to the kitchen to make coffee and never came back to his room. He went to his game room to make music and was in there for hours. I waited and waited for him to come and ask how I was doing but he never did and finally I just got up and snapped at him for not checking on me. He says he feels it’s unfair and that he can’t read minds and I get that and  usually make a point to communicate when I need something or how I feel but I feel like it’s a no brainer to at least ask if I’m okay before disappearing for hours right now. I know he can’t read my mind and I usually never expect him to but I just feel like he should have asked how I was doing today. He hardly said 3 words to me before disappearing.

"Hello, I’m M24 and I’m asking this due to me and my wife getting a new dog. I bought her and wanted to train her myself with positive reinforcement and clicker training! My wife didn’t really want her due to the breed, but she accepts and loves her all the same (yes, I got permission since she has her own two doggos) 

My question comes into play due to her in laws coming to visit. They started to play with my doggo which I was fine with. They stayed a week, and I didn’t know they were feeding her behind my back. I had set boundaries such as 1: Don’t feed her human food at all. 2: Don’t give her an overload of treats. I want to train her a little every day. 3: Don’t punish my dog. I’m responsible for her, not you. 

I didn’t think I would need to set boundaries on training, but I now caught them giving her a LOAD of treats and training her how to “sit”. I can assure you that if you force her to sit down and give her a treat when she stands up, it doesn’t teach her how to sit. Now my bond with her is broken due to them overloading her with food/treats. She’s food motivated. Of course I still have a strong bond, but it feels weird. I feel oddly angry and upset at this. I wanna confront them, but am I in the wrong? What should I do? Confront them or not?

TLDR; I’m upset because they are treat bombing and “training” my new doggo and it feels like the bond between me and her is breaking. It makes me so… angry? More like my chest hurts as I try to train her and play with her, but she runs straight to my in-laws who constantly give her treats? Should I confront them?",0,Male,original
" This is my first time posting and I'm on my mobile.

I 27F noticed that our roof was damaged 2 weeks ago, I mentioned it to my husband 29M twice. He did nothing, Sunday night it rained, the roof leaked as I expected it to. Monday he left work early sick, he's had a cold over the last week, I expected him to come home and go to bed but he came in and went straight to the video games.

After playing his game for a few hours I asked what are we going to do about the roof. I didn't think it came out harsh but he sure thought it did. He got up and went to check it out, it took him 10 minutes to do whatever he did, it wasn't pretty but at least the hole was covered I thanked him for doing it even though he didn't feel good. It rained again Monday night, it wasn't as bad but water was still coming down in my closet. He went to work Tuesday and again came home early not feeling well, again right to the video game. I said nothing. Today was his day off, I got up with our daughter and made sure we were quite so he could sleep in all while it's raining and water is coming down in my closet. The rain stopped and the sun came out. He got up around 11am and turned on a video game. I am not going to nag him, he knows what needs to be done but I was definitely annoyed. 

This is where I might be TA, I went out to work at my Dad's shop, while there I vented to him and my BIL. I knew if I told my Dad about the roof he would help me out, I didn't expect it to be today and I did not ask him to come. I did make my husband look bad because I not only complained about the roof but his lack of action today (he did not seem sick at all). I did tell them he has been sick and that he worked on it Monday, I knew I was kinda bashing him so I tried to balance it out with that. I came home and a few hours later while I was showering my husband busts in voice raised and basically cussed me out for asking Dad and BIL to come over saying I made him look bad. We have many issues but it's not common for him to talk to me like that and since I did make him look bad I wouldn't normally be upset but our daughter was in the other room which made it not okay. I didn't raise my voice but I did have a tone and told him I did not ask them to come, that I had complained about the roof and that I was grateful they were there since it didn't seem like anything else was going to be done about it by him. He griped and complained more with fuck being every other word all in front of our daughter who we do not cuss around. It's been hours since all of this and he has tried to act like none of it happened but I'm not accepting that. Any time we have an argument I'm the one to apologize for whatever wrong I did, he has never said sorry first and doesn't usually say it at all, he just wants to act like nothing happen. 

So AITA for making him look bad or was it justifiable because his lack of action is really what made him look bad?",0,Female,original

"My daughters dad and I split up almost five years ago. We got married young, I was only 19. It just didn’t end up working out, and we have a now 8 year old daughter. It was rough the first few months of the split, but one day we decided to just not argue anymore. We just do whatever is best for our kid, period. He helps me when needed, I help him when needed.
Today is my daughters last soccer game. We have always gone out to eat together as like a celebration after a “big” event. Dance recitals, cheerleading, everything. The last time we did was pre-covid, and we ate dinner out after getting pictures of our daughter done. I was living with my current partner then, and he did not give a single fuck about it. He actually made comments about how it was so great we got along so well. 

Well, moving back to today, he got pissed off we’re going out “like a family” and he can’t be there because he has work. I told him he is more than welcome to come with us, which he is. But he has work so like, it just is what it is. He made a huge deal about it, how it’s disrespectful to him and he can’t believe I would do that to him. But like… her dad and I have ALWAYS done it. It’s not about going out with him, it’s about taking my daughter somewhere to celebrate her and he will be there because he is driving down for her game. 
It turned into a huge argument, I told him it’s because he is so insecure (he has definitely been dealing with some insecurity issues lately due to finance issues due to covid and not feeling like he is “enough” for me, and I do everything in my power to tell and show him he is) but after arguing for half an hour and not getting anywhere, I just told him I wouldn’t go. Like whatever. I can take her out to eat tomorrow. 

But this morning, I’m not feeling so whatever about it. I’m really fucking sad I’m gonna miss her celebration lunch because he has decided to all of a sudden be insecure about my daughters dad, when I have never once given him a reason to have any worries about him. Neither of us has any desire to be with the other anymore. We were young and dumb, it wasn’t right for us. I have also lived with and been with my current partner for over two years. So it isn’t like it’s a new relationship. Even my abusive, controlling ex didn’t give a shit about us doing stuff with my daughter together. 

So, is it disrespectful to my current partner to go out with my daughters dad? He said something like “let me just call up one of my exes and go out to lunch with them”. But like… this isn’t just a random ex. It’s her dad. If he had that relationship with his sons mom I would not give a single fuck. AITA?

Update:

I just wanted to come back and say thank you all for the responses. I really appreciate the validation. 

After years of abuse, my trauma response is fawn and to just pacify. You are all 100% right that he is being controlling. I do recognize that, and am not okay with it, and have decided to stand up for myself always from this point forward. No matter what my trauma response tells me to do. 

My daughters dad and I sat at the game together for the entire time, so my daughter does not think anything else is going on. I told her I just wanted her to have a special lunch with her dad while he was down here and that we were going to celebrate after that. Which we did. She ended up having an entire day of celebrating her soccer season instead of just a few hours. 

I was able to discuss it with my ex, and he understands where my partner is coming from. Her dad helped me finance a car in June, and that is when this insecurity started. It’s not typical of him, and doesn’t happen with any other situation or any other person. Just him. Because her dad is stable and has a good job and my partner feels less than him right now. He is also more than happy to talk to him and explain to him how much he does NOT want me back 😂

But I will absolutely not put up with the same abusive toxic shit I did a few years ago, and the ones who said this is abusive behavior are right. It doesn’t matter what it stems from, it’s a HIM issue, not a me issue, and I’m done making changes to my life to pacify him. He can deal with what I choose to do, which is always in the best interest of my daughter, or we will leave. 

And to the people who sent me death threats because of this thread, thanks it really made me LOL during an anxiety ridden time. Also maybe get some therapy.",0,Female,original

My (22F) boyfriend (24M) injured his abdomen in 2019 and has problems with it ever since. The doctor has arranged for him to get a CT for his abdomen to see what’s causing the issues after so much time has passed. 

The letter he got stated he needed to go get a test kit the day before his imaging so today we went and did that. I explained to him that they told me he can mix the little bottle’s contents with cranberry juice or ginger ale. 

(For context he needs to mix it with 1L of liquid and drink half tonight, 1/4 an hour before the appointment and 1/4 30 mins before the appointment.)

I knew he was going to be entirely enthusiastic about it but I figured it wouldn’t be a huge deal because he’s been going on and on about getting the issue resolved. I was wrong.

He immediately started arguing about taking it saying he didn’t want to because he has to work tonight, it might make him sick or he might be allergic. I told him that his work knows he has a CT tomorrow so they’re not going to say anything about him preparing for it. I also told him that the chance of him being allergic is very slim and that he needs to take it for the imaging to work. 

He continued to refuse. I then told him to at least have the decency to call and cancel his appointment so someone who needs it can have it. He also refused to do this. 

When we got home I told him to try talking to his mom and see what she thinks because she’s been in the loop about the medical issue. He said no, so I ended up having her call and try to talk some sense into him. It didn’t work.

Now I’m frustrated and fed up. I’ve done 90% of the housework since his injury because I know he’s in pain and I don’t want to add to it. I’ve run countless baths, put a5-35 on countless times, heated the heat pack up for him and stood by and supported him at doctors appointments (that I made for him). 

So I finally snapped and told him that I’ve done everything for him since his injury to help, and now that he has a chance to find out what’s wrong and get it fixed he’s being immature and being too effing petty to have the decency to call and let the hospital give his appointment to someone who needs it more and wants help. I told him from now on I don’t want to hear one effing peep about him hurting and I expect him to start pulling his weight because if he won’t take the offered help then that’s his own fault and I won’t continue to baby him. 

I feel like maybe I went too far. I just want him to get the CT so we can finally get his abdomen healed and he can start enjoying himself again. So AITA?

EDIT: 
Thank you all very much for your help. After I calmed down a bit I sat down and talked to him. He ended up admitting that he’s scared they’re going to find something serious and that it didn’t really hit him that the CT was happening until we picked up the test kit. We’ve since picked up some ginger ale and mixed them. He has also apologized for his behaviour.",0,Female,original

The first morning I was at his apartment brushing my teeth and used his toothpaste because I didn’t bring my own.

"**  Can you please post any comments in here, this is the only therapy I can afford. Thanks***

Before judging me, please read my story with an open mind. Thank you

A small edit sorry :- Since people mentioned about his job, I ll type this. Yes he lost one of his dream jobs.. He wanted to join the defense and he lost his chance with one wing, he still has interviews for other wings and its not completely over.. I didn't write this to change your opinion of me, but to just mention about the job since few of you were worried about his mental health. He still has his family, my family and all our friends to help him get through this. I am alone because I moved out 

Edit2 :- I tried calling him but he didn't answer.. I even wrote him a text to read when he gets time.. Can't believe I have to be alone this year too 😔 🙃 

Final edit :- He messaged today (on my bday) that he wants to break up..its all over... So i think it's all my fault.. Thanks for everyone who commented... 

I (25F) have a bf (26M).  Him and I have been in a long distance relationship for the past 2 years in opposite sides of the world.

We have been together for 2 years with 95% of it in LDR. For my last year bday during the pandemic he said he couldn't get me anything because he couldn't use his card from his country for any transaction here and I told him to use my card because that's what my friends back home do all the time ... They basically order something sweet less than $25 to me in this country and credit the equivalent money back home or buy something for me there which they can give me when I return. Trust me I'm a sucker for memories and not materialistic and I have like 3 things that cost above $100 ( tv, a ring that I got for myself after getting my dream job and a pair of shoes which my friends gifted).

This year my birthday is tomorrow ( Sunday) and My bf had an interview for 5 days ( mon - Fri) where he is not allowed to use phone ( he has to stay in a military camp - this is an army exam.. Nvm about that) and in the end he figured out that he doesn't qualify for it anymore in life. That was his dream job since grade 6. He was really upset about it and we spoke about that for hours... Once he was a bit better I asked him today ( Saturday) if he planned anything for me.. He said he didn't have time to think about it because he was busy with the exam and now he is depressed. I told him that I mentioned about wanting something last year and he had the entire year to do something for me... He said he is too upset to think and we had a huge fight. In my defense.. All I wanted from him was a cake / chocolate and/or flowers. Nothing expensive and for which he could've used my card. He is no financial trouble back home too, so money is not an issue.

So people of reddit, AITA for expecting a gift on my bday..

"I(30M) and my wife(29F) have been married for 7 years. I work at a garage starting 4pm to about 1am every day. She works part time(for about 4 hours)at a daycare. We have a 6 year old. I do the laundry, cook breakfast and lunch for the family, pick up and drop my son to school, mow the lawn, vacuum and dust the house . She mops the house, cooks our son's meals and dinner for all of us(I eat leftovers after coming back from work), and helps him with his homework. She also gets groceries and grows vegetables at home. 

So I'll come to the situation at hand. 
I work a physical job and I also work out everyday for about 2 hours a day in the mornings at a gym nearby and do yoga in the afternoons before work as well. So I feel extremely hungry all the time and I eat a lot at every meal. This means I eat about 4 eggs and half a plate of bacon for breakfast, 2 burgers and a vegetable stir fry for lunch. During the evenings I drink a protein shake and for dinner at work I eat a few snack protein bars/fruits. My wife usually makes pasta, fish, meat or spaghetti for dinner. I eat that after coming home at around 1:30. My work is half an hour away from our house and I walk to and fro everyday. 

My wife said that I eat a lot and that I'm going to get obese again. I was offended by her choice of words as I am very concious of my health after I lost about 200 pounds over the last 4 years. I had gained weight shortly after our son was born because I never had time to look after myself because of the increased work at home(I don't regret the work one bit) and had started to get a multitude of health issues because of it. 

Now I'm in great shape thanks to working out every single day and eating mindfully. I even run frequent(once in 6 months) health checkups and my doctor said that I have a low body fat percentage and am at the perfect weight for my age. I'm not longer pre-diabetic, my high blood cholestrol has reduced drastically, my heart is working better now and I cando physical activities with ease now. I'm so happy about my current self and I felt hurt because she told me that I should be eating lesser. It's hard to tell myself not to eat less because I count calories and I require that much calories everyday because of how intense my workouts are. 

AITA for eating so much and thus causing her to have to make larger portions for dinner?

Edit: I eat about 3000 calories a day and workout to burn about 1500 calories at least..",0,Male,original
"I'm 24, he's 23, we've been dating 2 years. I've put on some weight this year and, thanks to my genes and ethnicity, it's all packed up behind me. He now acts like a dog around a tennis ball around me, he's constantly commenting on it, grabbing it( then giggling), smacking it.

It's more annoying than anything, and, its not like he wasn't attracted to me before this, but, the butt has really ramped him up to a new level.

We were going to go swimming last weekend and, I just didn't feel up to it at the last moment, I got "" cold feet"" no pun intended, and didn't want to. Rather than try and comfort me or just say "" fine, no problem"" he started this whole goofy "" I wanted to see that ass of yours"", like playful, or, intended to be playful, whining. 

I snapped and told him I'd really love it if he could stop focusing on my damn rear end. I don't really care if he's playing it for jokes, I don't feel great about it and his bringing it up doesn't help my psyche 

He feels like I should lighten up, learn to love it, and feels like I need to communicate my emotions better?

"Let me put you in context:
Be me, 25 yrs with a 9-5 job during weekdays.
Gf is also 25, weird Nightshift schedule, alternates 5 days per week and 2 days per week.

We usually do quite a lot of things together and with her family (my family lives abroad) we also moved to an unfurnished apartment and our ""free time"" has been dedicated to finding furniture and browsing that Swedish furnishing store. 

Lately she has been pushing to do one day trips during every weekend, one day trips meaning taking a plane in the morning and returning late at night (which I think does not make it a worthwhile experience) or taking the car to another city. She doesn't drive and I would be the one driving the 2-3h drive to the places she wanted to go and return, she mentioned taking the train to avoid car but the time is similar with the reduced flexibility of a car and having to obey by the train time.

The thing is that I do not personally mind these trips once in a while but she has been trying to make it happen on a weekly basis. We have also been doing more ""in city"" plans such as watching a stand-up comedian or going to have lunch or drinks, as well as watching series at home under a blanket. Which is to be fair the kind of plan I lean more to.

The issue came 2 weeks ago when she proposed to go to a village in the mountains and I forthright said I was not going to join this one because I wanted some alone time at home. (Hard week at work, general tiredness, and just wanting to do my own thing)
Since then she has been throwing shade at me for making plans with workmates arguing that ""I no longer wanted to do anything with her""  I must say during these weeks there was a couple of birthdays of work friends and I have met a few of them for sport events but this is not the norm for a usual week.

AITA for wanting that rest weekend for myself?",0,Male,original

Eversince My F33 husband M37 began working for this company. He became good friends with his co workers. His boss though is the strict type who doesn't telorate being late for work which is something my husband is guilty of and constantly gets in trouble for.



He is NOT a morning person. And hates waking up early. Always did.

I've taken it upon myself to wake him up since he is job was literally at jeaprody for constantly being late e

Every morning is an absolute nightmare. He'd stay in bed tol 7:30 refuses to wake up, he'd get so aggressive he'd knock off the alarm clock, Push his phone off the nightstand. Put the pillow over his head. Literally scream ""Go away I'm trying to get some sleep you ----!!!"" When I try to wake him up. I'd try everything from shouting to removing the pillow and sheets, to shaking him to tickling to spraying him with water. And he'd wake up eventually but be in a very bad mood.


Despite all that he'd end being late for work over a sock or waiting for his phone to charge. This is our life and I'm not complaining however...

It's Thanksgiving (we're in canada) he invited his co workers over for dinner. I could tell he was trying to ""impress"" them since they're older than him.
They were talking about how he's good in everything except that he's always late. He shrugged and said it's not his fault he's always late since he wakes up at 5:30, walks the dogs, gets the kids ready for school, make breakfast, clean up the kitchen, pack lunch then spend almost 40 minute waking me up. I was floored like I couldn't believe he was talking about us. I saw the judging look on his co workers faces as they all start telling him that their wives don't treat them this way. One of them asked me If I gave my husband ""thanks"" for the tremendous work he does but I said wait wait this couldn'd be further from the truth.
I said actually if it wasn't for me he'd never wake up. I'm the one who constantly wakes him up and he doesn't even know how to set his alarm properly let alone wake up to what he said he does. His coworkers got quiet and he look shocked. I explained how hard I try to wake him up everyday and they started side eyeing him. He looked upset yet embarrassed and went off on me once they left saying i ruined his reputation and embarrassed him infront of them just to feed my ego. He said ""it's thanksgiving and you ruined it for me, what's wrong with you?"" Then walked out. Idk if I should apologize for the awkward dinner.",0,Female,original

I recently got the chance to have a two week vacation and decided to accept my boyfriend offer to see his family. I asked my boyfriend what would be served and just checking in to see if what they would make won’t have Seafood/ Shellfish since I’m allergic to them. 

The day comes and I had a good time with them up until the time for us to eat, I noticed the food they had mostly had either seafood in it or was entirely seafood. I asked if they had anything else but my boyfriend insisted I should just eat a little to not be disrespectful. I stood my ground and informed him and his family I’m severely allergic to seafood and after they insisted that they won’t serve me or make anything that doesn’t have seafood, I thanked them and left. 

Today, I got angry text messages from my boyfriend upset that I disrespected him and his family and wanted me to apologize to them but I’m not going to.

"I wanted to pick out a nice anniversary present for my girlfriend, I had a couple ideas in mind but she showed particularly interest in a ring. Fast forward to today, I saved up money to buy her a ring with specific instructions from her about which rings are ugly and which are not. So I go to several jewelry shops looking for the perfect ring and finally find one that I think looks nice. Anyway I ask if they have the size my girlfriend told me her finger was. They bring out the size I asked for and I realize that it’s definitely way too big ( it was loose on my finger and my girlfriend has tiny hands whereas I have pretty average sized hands for a guy). So I message her and ask her to remeasure and she gets upset with me when I tell her the size she said was too big. So obviously I’m extremely frustrated as I have gone through the effort of picking out a ring to all her specifications and she just gets upset.

"Husband (50M) is a doctor but he quit his job for different reasons, the main one was that we have 2 year old twins and we are expecting a baby and he doesn't want to leave them with a nanny (neither do I). We talked for months about this and he finally decided to quit, most of our family supports him in this decision because they know that it was really difficult to make, but some people in my (26F) family find it funny and don't even try to hide it. 

We (my parents and siblings) have a family group chat and there we send some pics of our kids and stuff, and yesterday I sent them some pics of my kids helping my husband to cook, pics my husband sent me while I was at work, and their first reaction was to laugh and say that I should check if he's straight because it seems that he likes too much to play the wife role, they said that because since he quit his job he started online pastry classes, but that's not something new, even though he had a job he always loved pastry and stuff and I knew that.

My sister (28F) said that it wasn't okay to say those things, that the kids were happy with their dad and that was the only thing that should matter. But my dad (73M) said something like that something was clearly wrong with my husband if he decided to quit a high paying job to play the role of a wife and bake cakes.

For me all this is really hard because I love my family but I also love my husband and our kids and I know that they are happy now that they spend more time together, that's why I told my parents that if they continue to make fun of the decisions that my husband and I make they will not have a place in the lives of our kids, and they said that I'm just being dramatic, that they were only joking and that I have to learn how to take a joke. But for me that wasn't a joke, because a joke makes you laugh and I didn't laugh at all. But all that makes me think that what I said may be asshole behavior, and some of my siblings think I am, they said my parents have ""dark humor"" and that's why they said what they said, but I don't know, am I the asshole for threatening them with that?


Edit: I'm not supporting him, he has worked for 34 years (counting the years he wasnt a doctor) and has enough savings to live without my financial help.

Edit 2: Feel free to ask me anything about my relationship, but don't tell me ""well, you should lie about his age in your posts"" or things like that, I love him and I'm not gonna lie about his age because I'm not ashamed of my husband's age.

Edit 3: And for those who tell me I have ""daddy issues"", well maybe I do, not gonna lie. I guess this is how you end up when you're raised by a babysitter while your parents spend more than 10 hours away from home because their top priority is their careers. But despite that I wouldn't change anything, I love the family that I created with my husband and I also love that he chose our little family over his dream job.",0,Female,original

"This is my first time posting so please be gentle with my lack of correct formatting.
My (30F) fiancé (36M) and I bought a new house earlier this year and, because of Covid, we haven’t invited anyone to the house other than my FMIL. We finally had my fiancé’s cousin’s family and aunt come over last night. My fiancé is a chef, so he cooked them all a delicious meal and we were having a good time. Later in the evening, before we were going to give them the ‘house tour’, my FMIL pulled me aside and told me that she took the liberty of hiding the box of tampons I had out in our upstairs bathroom.

I asked her why she did that and she told me it was indecent because my cousin in law’s husband might see it. I laughed and told her that he might be very familiar with menstrual products already due to being married to a woman and all (as well as growing up with only his mom and 2 sisters).
She made a face and said that it just wasn’t decent to subject men to our troubles. I was floored. I went upstairs, took the box from under the sink where she stashed it, and put it where I always had it (just above the toilet on some shelves with other toiletries).

She followed me and asked what I was doing. I told her that I will not be told having a period is a shameful thing and that if men wanted to be with a woman, they need to grow up and deal with it because almost all women menstruate and use these types of products and that it was silly for women to continue and pretend that it doesn’t exist. She kept going on telling me I was dirty and indecent, and I yelled that it wasn’t like I was hanging my used products all over and rubbing it across the walls. I just reiterated that I won’t be controlled and shamed in my own home.
At that point, my fiancé heard us and came to see what was happening. After FMIL told him the ‘issue’, he rolled his eyes and told his mom almost exactly what I did and that if she felt uncomfortable about this, she could leave and how this isn’t worth having a fight about. 

His mother was seething when she grabbed her things and left our house, making a scene as she left and putting a huge awkward damper on our gathering. Right after she left I felt really bad, knowing my fiancé worked so hard to try and make it a pleasant evening and I basically ruined it. I could’ve just taken into consideration how FMIL comes from old ways of thinking and how maybe I should’ve just ignored her comments because she thought she was helping. Now wonder if I should just apologize to FMIL about this. 

My fiancé is a very zen person and told me I have no reason to apologize other than trying to keep the peace between us and his mom, but he would support me either way. He told me he would talk to his mother in a day regardless to unpack what just happened (he’s very into open communication because he never got that growing up).

"English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes.

So yesterday my boyfriend (21m) lent me (18f) 50€ for a Macbook. I desperately needed a laptop for school and the aunt of my boyfriend offered me to sell her barely used three years old macbook to me. I work in a cinema and I earn 450€ a month. She wanted 500 which is not a lot for the quality I would receive. So for context: I live alone and I need to earn my own money to be able to afford this and go to school. My dad is supporting me with all he can but he's not a millionaire either. I already get the money from the child benefit (around 230). I also have a car which I have to pay completely (like fuel costs and stuff). I need this car to get to school and work in time. 
So here's the problem: I thought I would get money from the government this month but turns out I'll get it at the 30th of October. Not one day before. Because of that I told my boyfriend that he'll get the money as soon as I would get the child benefit my father sends me. I said that because I thought I would have the money from the government by then (what I got promised btw). But I don't, child benefit is on my bank account today. And I need this money to survive. My salary is gone by now because of the mac I got. So I'm relying on those 230 euros to buy food, fuel etc. But now my boyfriend (who knows about my financial situation) demands his money back. After I told him that I don't have the government money yet and that I needed the money to get through the month he got mad. He told me that he paid money he doesn't have either (he lives with his grandma and doesn't have to pay anything, he also has a well-paid job and he also got 50 bucks from his aunt from who I bought the mac from) and that I said he'll get it as soon as I got my child benefit and so on and so on. He told me ungrateful and unreliable and an asshole for not keeping my promise. In the end I just told him I would give back the MacBook to pay him back and to survive the month. He seems calmed now. 
I know I shouldn't have lent money and buy something before I have a stable financial situation but I just trusted him and relied on him. And it was a chance I wouldn't get that quick either. I would have bought the mac later if it wasn't the only time his aunt was around in years. I'm just so disappointed I feel that he doesn't care at all how I'm doing. I would have given him the money back at the end of the month and he knew that. He also knew that I needed the government money before I would be able to pay him back. I'm just sad and confused if I'm the asshole. I'm going to give the Mac back anyways but I just wanted to hear some opinions on this.

"Ok it's an account just made for this post because my girlfriend has a Reddit account and she shouldn't know about this unless I do confront her about it.

Let's get started: My girlfriend (22f) is called Alice and she has a family consisting only of her older brother, her brother's girlfriend and about four other couples (She and her brother have cut ties with their biological family). I know them and have noticed for some time that there is a strange pattern of behavior in this group.

All women tend to be passive, quiet and highly prone to excessively old-fashioned manners, while men tend to be very distant, cold, and authoritarian. When we had coffee at the house of one of the couples, the girl was the one who got up to pick up the cups, and her boyfriend didn't get up until we were all leaving.

Alice is also the kind of woman with old-fashioned ""Miss"" manners who tends to get up to do her chores and get upset when I do them first because ""She can't sit around all day"" and that I should let her do more than what. we have already agreed.

"So, I got married to my husband 4 years ago and now I always seem to have an escort/babysitter with me. It started originally because we were staying in my husband’s native country, and he insisted that they were there to keep me safe, even though I had been to the country before without him and was perfectly fine on my own. I gave in because he was persistent, and his family all seemed to have similar arrangements, so I felt like I was the weird one for not being okay with it.

Over the years it has become a full-time thing, no matter what country we’re in. It’s annoying and embarrassing. I don’t even meet up with my old friends anymore because having someone hovering behind you 24/7 is not something any of us have ever been used to and it completely ruined our friendship dynamic. The only time I don’t have anyone with me is if I go to see family and that’s only because I made a huge stink over it. 

Recently I reconnected with a friend of mine. By chance we were going to be in the same city at the same time and she asked me to hang out. I lost touch with her before I met my husband so the escort thing would definitely be weird to her. I ended up sneaking out of the house like a teenager so I could see her without an escort. 

When my absence was noticed my phone was blown up by my husband, in laws and my usual escort. When I finally returned home, he was furious with me. He said I was acting like a teenager, and he was going crazy thinking something bad could’ve happened to me. I did apologise but he's still upset with me.

During these 8 weeks, my (28F) boyfriend (28M) of 4 years has been freaking out about the situation because his name won't be on the house (we are renting together now) and he wanted to take this step together in the future. The issue is that his idea is to buy a house in the next 3-4 years and I'm ready now, so I said we could always buy a bigger place later.

My boyfriend has been getting mad several times a week about the smallest things, saying how I'm only buying a house to copy my friends, how I'm going to kick him out, complaining that he wanted us to go on more holidays and I'll now be sinking all my money into the house (alone, he's not putting any money in).

He's been going through a tough time as someone he's close to has terminal cancer and said that moving and dealing with a new house is an extra stress he doesn't need.

I volunteered to pull out of the sale and he said not to do that and that he'd get over it, but the situation hasn't improved.

I don't think my relationship is in the place it should be and the only reason I'm buying in the area is because of him so I pulled out of the sale. I have told friends that it's because of delays on the seller's part which is partially true.

When my boyfriend asked about it I told him it was actually because we've been fighting about it and I didn't want to buy unless we actually sorted out the issues.

"So this just happened like an hour ago, but there is a bit of a back story. 

We had one of those lighters with the long stems, and the flame was super short. So, about 3 weeks ago, I took it apart and fixed it so that the flame was normal sized. My wife took it out of the drawer today to light a candle while I was sitting there working away and it caught on fire. Like huge ball of flame on fire. Within one second of this happening my wife threw down the lighter on the kitchen counter where I was working and while I was grabbing her phone off of the counter she blew on it to put the flames out.

I think that this situation resolved itself very quickly and that I couldn’t have done anything else. 

Now, I’m probably the asshole for fixing the lighter poorly, but am I the asshole for not freaking out more?

"Throwaway acc for privacy purposes (also first post ever!)

My (22F) boyfriend (23M) and I recently rescued a dog after living together for about a year. Getting her was my idea but we discussed it for multiple months before going forward and agreed that we would share responsibilities. However, ever since we got her I have been doing everything-- taking her to the vet, feeding, training, etc. with minimal help from my boyfriend.

Today, I watched her the entire day while he was at school. I have a remote job that I work and my shift started immediately after he got home. As I was on a call with a client, he put her in my office with me and left to go get groceries (we have a fully stocked fridge and last got groceries on Monday). Our dog barked and started acting up significantly more than usual while I was on the call (not her fault) which resulted in the client calling my boss (this was the first time). When he came home, I confronted him and he said he wanted to get the ingredients so that he can make bread for one of his female friends. \[Not a one-off event, He's been baking cookies, muffins, bread, etc., and dropping them off late at night, around 11 pm, for her since we got our dog, resulting in me functionally watching our dog for the entire day.\]

I got super angry and told him that he's obsessed with baking for a girl he doesn't date at the cost of not supporting me and our dog and that our relationship and getting a dog w him was a mistake. He told me I was jealous and that I was an asshole for not supporting his friendships and hobbies. I think I might be the asshole and overreacting, but I'm just really frustrated.",0,Female,original
"A little background, my husband and parents go on an annual weekend vacation to see our favorite sports team play an away game. We could go in 2019 for personal reasons and obviously couldn’t go in 2020 or 2021. Also my husband’s birthday is 4 days after my brothers. We started talking about which one might work us in 2022. There were two options which we considered One fell over the weekend of my brothers birthday. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable asking my parents to miss his birthday. He said he understand and we could go with the other option. He brought it up with and stated that was the best weekend for all four of us to go and that his birthday was the following week. Later I told him I thought it was inconsiderate for him to assume my parents would even consider missing my brother’s birthday. AITA for calling him inconsiderate?",1,Female,original
"I (20F) and my bf (21M) have been together for more than a year. We have very different personalities but somehow managed to accept each other and are quite in love. I suffer from depression and anxiety before I even met him, and he is aware of that. In our country, there’s mandatory military service for 2 years, and he’s currently going through it. He isn’t an army guy at all and therefore isn’t enjoying his time in there.

He sometimes would tell me about his day in quite an emotional way. I could say it’s emotional dumping. He would also say things like “oh you will never get it” and stuff like that, which makes me heartbroken. I’ve been asking him to tell me in advance before venting, because I really need to prepare myself for it and also I might not be in the right mind for it. He has always rejected the idea ever since day 1 and I haven’t been pushing for it either, since we haven’t been meeting with any vents lately. However, he has been having a rough few weeks lately and has been telling me about it in long chunks of messages and it just makes me feel very overwhelmed. When I bring up the idea of asking me whether I’m emotionally available first, he said he’s available for me 24/7, but i’m “available on subjected dates only” and that makes him upset that I’m telling him to “stfu when upset”. I do realise my shortcomings because I’m not in the army and we have quite different philosophies, that I also have clingy tendencies but I’m working to change that. I always try for him, yet I feel under-appreciated most of the time after he vented. I plan to put my foot down and made him promise to adhere to my boundaries or else we’re going to have to re-evaluate the relationship. Am I the asshole?

Update: Thank you for all the responses. He apologised to me the next morning. This argument happened when he was at the military base over text. He said sorry for losing his temper at because he was frustrated over some unrelated things that happened in the camp. He also said that he agreed to work on it with me and that he’ll be making sure none of us are being compromised even in an emotional situation :)",0,Female,original
"I (29f) and my Husband (33m) are a blended family. I have a son (5) from a previous relationship and get along great with my ex who provides so much for our son (he's a great dad). My husband has a 3 year old daughter and together we have a 4 month old daughter. My SD's mom is not in her life at all and signed away her rights and OD'd after a heroin addiction, so she lives with us full time.

After my daughter was born, I became a SAHM to take care of my kids (discussed when I was pregnant and I did mean to her but post partum has been bad so I have changed what I originally anticipated) My husband works and provides for the family financially. When I became a SAHM, my husband assumed that I would take care of all the kids including his daughter (at the time I 100% agreed) He said that he was clear when we dated that his daughter did not have a mother and he wanted whoever he married to take on a full parental role especially since her mom did not want her to show her that she was deserving of a mother's love. I agreed to this and agreed since I met her when she was a year old. (I call SD my daughter, but using SD in this post for clarity)

However now after having a baby, I want to take care of my kids because I am so overwhelmed and would like my husband's family to watch my SD. My husband is furious at me and says he provides for the whole family and I wanted to be a SAHM. He said I agreed to take care of SD and treat her as my own when we dated. I said that things have changed. He argued with me saying that he provides for my son and I countered saying that his dad does a lot for him. My husband got upset with me and said he knows he has a great dad but still takes care of him and treats him like he is own son. He accused me of being an evil stepmom and hating his daughter (I do not hate his daughter, I am just overwhelmed with 3 little kids). Note: I had a traumatic birth and suffer from PPD so this is not a permanent request of mine. My ex helps out more than usual with our son because of this

So AITA for only wanting my SD to be home when my husband is there?

edit: i live far from my family. My ex is the only one who can help with my son (though my husband's family does treat my son like their own... I just felt like it would be unfair to let his family watch my son when I could give more time to my ex since he runs his own company and has flexible hours). My husband has a lot of family that can help with SD.

# Update: talked to my husband when he came home and he agreed I needed more help. I told him that I love SD the same and that I am overwhelmed and he told me he knows and just got stressed with SD's history with her BM. I asked if he could hire a nanny and he wants to save money for a new house in the district where my ex lives because the schools are better and he wants it to be easier for my son to go between houses when he is older so he struggles less with having to switch homes (he's just the best husband). I called my mom and she is coming to help me for a few months with ALL my kids and my husband's in laws are going to come over and help as well and take the kids out. My husband is taking a week off of work to get everything settled. I also plan on having 1 on 1 time with both the older kids, and my husband and I plan on having a date tomorrow while the kids are at his parents home so that we get a night off. Lastly I want to say that I love my SD with my whole heart. I will never stop being grateful that my little girl calls me mama. I will never forget the honor I get of being her mom. I am going back to the doctor tomorrow because I clearly need more help.",1,Female,original
"Throwaway account so no one in my personal life sees this. 

I (26M) am currently in a fight with my girlfriend ‘Jess’ (21F) over her feeling uncomfortable with my new friend ‘Amy’ (19F). I met Amy a couple of days ago at a convenience store and we both seemed to hit it off quite well, and I just have this feeling that her and I are going to be friends for a long time. However, my girlfriend says she is uncomfortable with this but won’t give me a reason why other than saying Amy’s age makes her uncomfortable. I have apologized to her over and over and tried to comfort her, but she still wants me to drop this friend over jealousy. I validated her feelings but explained that I will not ghost a friend I just made. Now she says she does not want to hang out with me tomorrow and will be with her friend who is also her FWB and will be sleeping over. We have an open relationship but I have not been with anybody else, but I’m not against it, and part of me thought that Amy might end up being my FWB.

My friends are telling me that my girlfriend is in the right and she has every right to be upset with me. But this is the hill I’m going to die on because I had an abusive ex in the past, who restricted my friendships and made me lose friends.

"My husband has a housekeeper whose granddaughter “Lucy” works on and off for my husband. I really like her. She told me that during my separation (which only ended recently and lasted for close to two years) she overheard my husband’s best friend “Matthew” calling me a witch. 

Actually, the conversation they had was much longer than that and NSFW so I’m not going to go into detail, but he was telling my husband he needed to move on, and my husband told him he thought I had broken his body and he didn’t think he could move on and Matthew said he had been trapped by a witch. The conversation was a lot more vulgar and rude in reality.  

The day after Lucy told me this, Matthew came to our house, but my husband was stuck in a meeting, so I had to entertain him until he was done. I didn’t plan to confront him because I know my husband is funny about people who work for him gossiping and I didn’t want Lucy to get into trouble since she needs the job but when Matthew was pretending to be all fake nice and happy to see me, I couldn’t hold my tongue and I snapped at him. I asked him if he was really happy to see the nasty witch come back. He denied it at first and then tried to justify it as “guy talk”. We argued with each other, and it only stopped after my husband walked in and asked us why we were arguing. Matthew told him and my husband asked me who told me that. I refused to tell him which upset him. 

Matthew did apologise but honestly, I was still angry since I felt like they were ganging up on me so I told my husband I wouldn’t be entertaining his friends anymore and he better manage his schedule better next time. He’s mad at me because I won’t confirm who told me, but we both know he knows it was Lucy since no one else would tell me gossip.

"This wasn't my first s/o with kids. I was prepared to not have any real authority with his 2 daughters. I've navigated the family dynamic as well as i can. 

My childhood was about absolute obedience and labour. His upbringing was progressive but also neglectful. He lost his childhood to caretaking his grandfather with early onset alzheimers.

It hasn't been rainbows- we both have psychiatric disorders- we cope, work on things. But after dozens of conversations about my ptsd triggers and mutual respect in the home, things have gotten steadily harder. Never moreso than when his daughters came to live with us full time. 

He's very tidy and responsible so it never occurred to me that when they came to live with us they would not be given chores.  

None.

When Covid hit, I resigned my warehouse job. I was left with everything. Cooking, cleaning, meal planning. They would ""help"" me briefly when asked, expect praise, then immediatly go back to their phones.

Though we have enough money for food, i began skipping all of my personal favorites to avoid being treated like i was selfish for buying anything they don't like.

He says he can't infringe on their childhood, but at the same time, he also can't make himself just appreciate what i get done without criticising things like how i fold shirts. He'll wake me up hours before my alarm to be angry at me because the dishes aren't done or he can't find socks. I'm on edge all the time just waiting for the criticism. 

It all came to a head. Our cats got fleas, we had to treat the house. Everyone was itchy and it sucked- but apparently cleaning and killing fleas was my pet project, not a household project. 

When his oldest daughter (19) left 4+ loads of dirty laundry from her closet floor (where her cat sleeps) in the diningroom for a week while she was at her boyfriend's, I got blamed for it. For not finishing the cleaning i had started. 

That broke the camel's back. I slept on it. The next day i talked with his mom and then i had a talk with him. 

I am staying with her for the next 6-8 months to help her clean and prepare her home to sell it.  I am boxing my nonessentials and, if things don't get seriously better, i'm looking for an apartment.  

I have been living 4 blocks away for one week. He is having fits taking care of everything by himself. I'm scraping old paint, washing floorboards, clearing out mouse nests. He had 3 loads of laundry this week and dishes daily and is FINALLY pissed that his kid just doesn't do. Pissed and insulted and all i can say is ""yeah, that's rough"". 

Am i an asshole for quitting the home? That i would rather live in and clean an old broken down house that smells like mouse and dog shit than to keep cleaning up for my family? Is it just petty that if my husband doesn't have a moment of ""oh, shit, she made life better"" and apologize for shaming me looking at a box of frosting-free poptarts, i'm not going back?",0,Female,original
"Ok so my girlfriend (f18) became pregnant with my first daughter a few months back. We were so happy because we both have wanted a daughter and thought for a long time about what to name her. We decided on a name which we both loved and wanted to keep it a secret. We decided to tell one of our mutual friends as he was to be The Godfather of our daughter. 

Recently, however, we found out that him and his girlfriend have been pregnant for a little longer and had not come up with a name. He came forward and said that they were going to name her the same first and middle name that me and my girlfriend had come up with. His logic was that his daughter was going to be born first so he should have the name. 

Me and my girlfriend thought for days and weeks to come up with a name that was special to us and suited her. I politely asked him to please change the name as we had come up with it and had set a name far before him. He said that I was being unreasonable and that I was in the wrong. Aita for this?

Update:
After speaking with him he stated that we would need to find a new name for our daughter since he does not want them to have the same name. If you would like to know this is no longer the issue. We are no longer speaking and he is no longer a god father.

"I'm not sure if I'm being controlling or if I'm justified, and I could use some perspective. 

My (22F) boyfriend (23) has been living with me for about 10 months, but we've been together for over 2 years. We both graduated from college in May 2020, and I was fortunate to find a job in December 2020. I had to move and since bf had not found a job yet I invited him to move in with me at the new city. He has yet to find a job, and the little savings he had ran out a good while ago, so I have been paying for everything. I'm ok with this, since he does a good job taking care of the house we are renting and he keeps my pets company while I'm at work, it's a lot of stress I don't have to deal with. He has been submitting applications daily, but very few have responded. 

Recently though, he got an interview for a job that would basically be his dream starting job, and get him experience in the industry he really wants to work in. His first interview was about 2 weeks ago. He did another interview a week later. After the first interview, I told him he should expect to have to take a drug test, so he should stop smoking weed. He agreed, and stopped smoking for the time. We both smoke weed regularly, I do most days after work. It's not legal in our state, so getting a positive on a drug test would certainly mean he won't get the job. When I was interviewing for my current job, I stopped smoking so I could pass a drug test. While I didn't like it, that's what you have to do. 

Now it's been about 2 weeks since he last smoked. I am still smoking most days after work, and he has been relentlessly pressuring me to let him have some weed. I told him no repeatedly, said he should keep in mind his drug test, and if he really wants something to relax he can take my card and get a beer at the gas station down the road. He did this a couple times, but he gets really upset and says it's unfair that I can smoke but he can't. I told him he smoked when I had to stay sober for my drug test, so I don't get why he's getting so upset with me. On top of it, I'm the only person buying the weed, so as far as I'm concerned, it's my weed. I don't have to share, and he can get his own when he can pay for it. 

But 2 days ago (last Friday) he just wouldn't drop it, so I caved and said ""fine, you're an adult, you can fail your drug test if you want, but I think you're making a mistake"". He said he was only going to smoke that day, but of course Saturday night he smoked again. If he wants to smoke again tonight I think I am just going to cut him off. I don't want to be a control freak, and I hate bringing up the fact that I pay for everything, because I know he's trying, but it makes me so angry to see him being so careless with this possible offer in his dream field after being unemployed for over a year. It makes me feel taken advantage of. AITAH here?",0,Female,original
"Posting from phone.
I (31f) have been married to my husband (34m) for five years. We have been renting together for four years. Since I am paid fortnightly and he is paid monthly, when we started renting, we have set up a system where, when each of us us paid, we would deduct expenses and split the disposable income from each pay equally. He benefits from this by getting more disposable income than he would if he lived on his own salary. I make a bit more than he does.

The problem comes where every month he ends up spending his half and then asks me for money from my half. He doesn't monitor his spending so he only realizes this when his account is empty. And then he always guilts me as he now doesnt have money to pay for gas or buy food. I have told him that this is unfair as he is already getting a fraction more than he actually makes. But he keeps reiterating that he goes out to work while I work from home so he would spend more so he should get more than me. 
(I want to insert that any extra money I have at the end of the month I dont keep it for myself. I put to our savings as ge doesn't save)

Im getting fed up of feeling taken advantage of, so I proposed to him from the new-year to end the system and we instead have a joint account for bills and we live on our own salary. He blew up at me saying that I am holding my higher salary over him. He also brought up that he wants to do a course to learn a different skill to potentially earn more money. Hes saying I'm unsupportive because I told him I won't foot the bill for that unless I see him making better financial decisions and start saving.

I feel like I might BTA because I know he was unable to manage when he had more disposable so now if I stop basically sharing my income he may be in a worse position.

"Account created solely for this.

About four years ago I left my wife. It was not an amicable split. It lasted much longer than it needed to, was very emotional, and created a lot of hurt. It was my decision to leave and my timing was not good.

Our affairs were complicated and took a long time to untangle. Part of this saw her house being used as security for debts which were by the nature of our separation agreement *my* debts. There was no tangible impact to her though had I defaulted there could have been. I never did but the arrangement caused a lot of stress for her and she feels it prevented her from moving on with her life. Security was eventually lifted but it was a situation that dragged on needlessly due to ongoing disagreements and refusals to agree to conditions that could have seen it lifted sooner.

That's history. A few years later I have a new partner and an apartment. We decide to move in together; I would sell my apartment and we would get a townhouse. The townhouse is quite close to my ex wife. About 3.5kms by road. For context, my apartment was about 6kms away. I was aware that she was upset when I bought my apartment because she felt it was too close and the hurt I caused her meant she could not be comfortable in the area for fear of running into me. I didn't give that much consideration. We have both lived in the same city since the 80s, it shouldn't be surprising that both of us would still live here now that we are separated.

She learned about where my new townhouse is and I found out through my son it has made her even more upset. She is saying I ruined her life again and now she has to sell her house and rebuild her life again elsewhere because I have tainted the area with my presence. She feels I am  intentionally being cruel to her and after spending years rebuilding her life she now has to tear it up and flee because of me. I think this is ridiculous. I have no intention to have anything to do with her and any  feeling she has about my ""presence"" is on her and something she needs to fix in her own head.

My (adult) son is upset with me. He says I knew what my moving to the area would  mean and says I should have chosen somewhere else. He spends a lot of time with his mother and has to deal with her outbursts so I understand his frustration. I am told she is suffering waves of depression and rage and other similar behaviour, (which had happened in times of high stress before and after our separation.)

So AITA?

In brief: After a long, chaotic, and hurtful separation from my wife I bought a townhouse that is relatively near to where she lives. She feels that by doing this I have again ruined her life and she has to sell up and leave. My son is upset with me because I knew what my decision would mean and I did it anyway. I may be an asshole because that is essentially true; I did know she would likely react this way. I still  don't thnk that's on me and I don't see how her thoughts and feelings should dictate where I live.

Edit #2:

Judgement received. Not perhaps the result I would have liked but I appreciate the frank and thoughtful responses people gave.

I still do not feel at fault for how badly the separation went or for my ex wife's specific reaction. I did as well as I could in the circumstances and while I will take my share of the blame I won't accept all of it. I do think she is being unreasonable by believing my actions have forced her out of her home or that I have tainted what she feels is her terriroty. I hope she reconsiders for my son's sake if nothing else. She certainly doesn't need to do anything so drastic as moving from her home. I don't mean her any malice. I don't want to have anything to do with her.

However I do feel the ruling is just. I may not feel entirely responsibe for the situation but I was aware of it. I was aware it would be problematic but I compartmentalised that because it got in the way of what my partner and I wanted. I can accept that as the behaviour of an asshole.

Hindsight is 20:20. In retrospect I should have raised my intention to move where I have with my son. Faced head-on the likely implications. Given some thought as to whether this house was truly worth causing that strife.

"my boyfriend and i met the summer after my freshman year of college while i was working and staying at home. my college is 4.5 hours from my hometown. 

when we started getting more serious about a long term relationship, i made it very clear to him that we probably wouldn’t be able to see each other very often, maybe every few weeks. 

when i first moved back to my college town, my roommates hadn’t moved in yet. he was coming to visit for 3-5 days at a time, and he would only leave for 2-3 days before coming back. 

eventually, my roommates approached me and asked me to not have him come down unless i’ve got days off because they’re uncomfortable with him being alone in the house, which is understandable. i told him about it and there was a small argument but nothing to be super worried about. 

since he was so used to being here so much, he wasn’t a fan of not seeing me so often. after i started classes, he stopped being able to visit nearly as often. with that and two jobs, i have no time to go home either. it’s very hard to get enough days off to make the drive worth it, and even meeting in the middle is difficult. 

he’s been telling me that he doesn’t feel like he is one of my priorities anymore. i have been telling him that obviously he is a priority of mine, but so is my education. he doesn’t get that i am paying 60k+ for my degrees and with the way that my school works missing even a couple days of class could mean an F.  

i told him that i’m here for another 2.5 years (possibly more if i add a degree) and that he needs to get used to this. he got very mad when i said that and i didn’t know how to respond other than telling him that this is what i was expecting from the beginning and what i told him to expect too. i didn’t tell him this, but i refuse to put a boy above my education at this time in my life.

My husband has a habit of signing me up for stuff at church- meal prep for people, greeting people in the morning. Snack sign up, etc. I work full time, do most of the housework, do the bulk of stuff for our kids, manage our finances, and the list goes on and on. I also buy the majority of gifts (almost all) for our kids and both sides of the family. 

I am also taking classes and recently began my Ph. D. Program. 

I am stretched THIN.

The past few years we agreed to fill shoeboxes for kids in other countries. This year when boxes were passed out I opted not to because the last two years I almost missed the deadline and had to scramble at the last minute. It takes me awhile to buy for each box because I want to jam as much as possible in them and choose things I think they will like. I search for dolls, games and toys that are popular on their culture. I also include a translated letter and pictures of us. 

This year I was going to opt out. I made this clear and explained why to my husband. He agreed to be in charge of the boxes. Fine.
We leave at noon tomorrow to go out of town. The boxes are still empty. I just reminded him that he needed to fill the boxes before we leave. He said they are just as much my responsibility as his. I said no. I am NOT filling them. I opted out. 
I still need to pack both kids for the trip as well as myself. I also need to finish up a bit of course work. 
He is pissed and said the kids shouldn’t suffer. 
I agree. But I didn’t promise to fill the boxes and I am not about to half-ass filling them. 
His promise. His responsibility. 
He’s now huffing and puffing and is angry because he has to go to the store. We live in a small town so to go to a Walmart or Target is 30-45 min drive one way. 
I help out A LOT and am striving to set boundaries and say no but these are kids- so I might be TA.

TL;DR- husband promised to fill Christmas boxes for kids in another country. I am swamped and can’t fill them but they are due this weekend. Husband is angry he has to hold up his end of the promise without my help. Kids are in the mix so AITA for not making time?

Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. Thank you for helping me realize I am NTA here. I can’t get to all the comments (too much time) but I  posting here to address the most common comments. 

To those who said set boundaries- that is exactly what I am doing- or, well, tried to do by declining and placing the onus back on him. 

To those saying I am going to snap- Yes. I am back on anti anxiety meds and back with a therapist who is helping me articulate and stick to boundaries. 

We did talk prior to me taking on the doctoral program and he promised to help more. Clearly it isn’t happening. Another discussion- errr…. A come to Jesus talk is in order. I can’t sustain the level I am at. It can’t be done without major negative consequences.

"For some context, my boyfriend grew up in a conservative Christian household with a strict mother and was never allowed to do anything remotely feminine or support the LGBTQ+ community.

I have been in a long distance relationship with one of the kindest souls I have ever met for almost 8 months now and we even met last Saturday for the first time. He and I grew up in way different environments so there were a lot of barriers in our relationship for a while. His family raising him under traditional Christian beliefs, he never spoke to anyone openly LGBTQ+ until me, openly bisexual and non binary. He never questioned his sexuality or gender until me. Just about what you'd expect from a teenager. And me having grown up in a house with a lot of freedom, he looked up to me in a way I guess. Eventually, he came out as bisexual and began to use any pronouns, I don't think he put a label on his gender yet. But either way, he and I have always talked about putting on suits and dresses together. Since I'm AFAB, I said I'd wear a suit if he ever wore a dress. And that has always been an ongoing thing.   


He moved in the summer and made a bunch of new friends at school who support him and he started painting his nails with Sharpie, typical ""rebellious teen"" stuff. Well his friend, we'll call them Rue, used actual nail polish to paint his nails. I was alright with that because I saw how happy it made my boyfriend. Why would I be upset when he is smiling from ear to ear. But today my boyfriend told me that Rue was going to bring him a dress to change into at his homecoming dance. I don't know why that was the breaking point but I was filled with so much anger and jealousy, I could've started to cry right there. I wanted to be the first one to paint his nails, but that's not a big deal. That's fine. But I always thought me being in a full suit for the first time and hi being in a dress for the first time was something we would share. He noticed I seemed a bit off but I didn't want to say anything and upset him so we just stopped talking and focused on school for the rest of the day.

&#x200B;

I got home from school and took a nap. When I woke up, I saw that he had texted me. Something completely unrelated happened with work and got me frustrated and upset again so the jealousy came back. He noticed and asked me to open up. Me, not wanting to hide anything from him, did and he got really upset. We didn't fight or anything but I could tell he felt really bad. He asked me if I wanted him to say never mind about the dress and I told him it was alright because he seemed so excited about it. It feels selfish to make him say no to it. AITA?

edit: we talked it over and i apologized to him. i told him that if he wanted to wear a dress and paint his nails that was his choice and i would stand by him. i’m trying to not let my jealousy and emotions get the best of me",1,Female,original
"My bf and his grandparents treated me to an expensive dinner three nights ago. it was a lot of food so i had some left over and brought it home. the next night i went out of town to see a friend. i come back to see more than half of my leftovers eaten. i told him that he should’ve asked to eat most of my leftovers. he then told me it was only half and i was being selfish for being upset. i didn’t yell at him or raised my voice, i just told him that he should ask me. however, the food was in HIS refrigerator and this is his house so i don’t know if i was justified for telling him to ask me. this isn’t the first time he has ate my leftovers or food but it’s usually cheaper stuff like chips or a cheap meal idrc about that considering i could easily buy more. so, AITA for getting upset and telling him to ask me next time.",0,Female,original
"My wife is 23, I'm 25, we were married last November. She did not go to college after high school. She just really did not enjoy school and didn't want to, at that time, take on the 4 year degree. She got the itch though, to at least get an associate's degree, she felt like it would give her a sense of fulfillment. 

&#x200B;

The problem, more and more frequently, was that I was doing the work for her. She'd have a paper due, for example, and rather than take it on herself, she'd beg me, guilt trip me really, do a whole cutesy puppy dog pout, sad eyes, "" Baby, c'mon please, I love you"" thing, top it off with hugs and kisses, until I cracked. I'd type up a paper and she'd go in, keep most of it, but would change it a bit so it sounded like her. I felt guilty from the start because A) it's dishonest and B) if I'm doing the work, than she's not learning anything and it's just me going to college again.

&#x200B;

The guilt became too much, I told her I was done, and that her work was going to have to be hers. She feels that I'm abandoning her and not fulfilling the role of being a helpful partner. She wants to find a happier medium wherein, I'm still doing a chunk of the work, but, not so much that guilt comes in, which, I don't think can be done. She says if and when her grades tank, I'll be the one to blame.

"To start, my husband and I keep our pre-marital money in separate pots and all incoming money in a joint pot. All our income and expenses go in and come out of the joint pot and it's something we both wanted and I feel like I should also say that his pre-marital pot was bigger than mine when we got married.

Last year, my former company IPO'd and so my premarital pot is pretty big now. There's this place my parents usually rent out a cottage for a week or so during the summer but last year, it was all booked up. So this year, it's all booked up again and my parents were talking about how there's one cottage currently being listed but it'd be quite the stretch for them. So I decided that I pay for half the cottage (\~100k for my half). Also, the only reason I took that job is because of encouragement from my parents, it paid less than my other offers but I thought what they were doing was interesting. So we got the cottage and they over the moon! They've been there every other week this summer. 

So my parents like to exaggerate, they've been telling their friends I bought the cottage for them even though I only paid for half and word got to my inlaws. They've been wanting to move closer to us for a while, so they want us to help them purchase a house near us. They'll sell their current home and use some savings so the extra that we'd have to cover would also be about 100k. However, this amount would drain most of my husband's pot and I don't want to take that much from our joint pot. My husband isn't pressuring me at all, I agreed at one point, but he vetoed it because I didn't sound fully okay with it. My inlaws think I'm TA because I'm treating them differently from my parents and they think all assets should be joint in a marriage.

Though we agreed everything earn after marriage is joint, he earns about 50% more than me. I'm also getting messages from others from his side of the family telling me I'm being selfish, that I'm freely spending his money (in our joint pot) but preventing him from using it on his parents. So maybe I should be okay with him taking that much out from our joint pot since he earned more of it? So am I the asshole for not wanting so spend the money on my inlaws even though I did the for my parents?

Edit: For those calling my parents liars, apparently they just said I helped them with the purchase and seems like by the time it reached my in-laws threw threw the broken telephone, the thought I bought the whole thing. But even if I did, it’d still be with my money, not my husband’s.",0,Female,original
"My fiancé (24F, together 4 years, engaged for 2) and I (24M) both make enough to support ourselves independently, but live together in a house we rent. I make slightly less than her (still over $75K post tax), but it’s equal enough that splitting bills 50/50 is fair, we have a joint savings account for our wedding and future expenses that we contribute equally to, and our own separate bank accounts for everything else. We call it our “fun money,” since we have no kids and don’t plan to have any for a few years.

I don’t criticize her purchases, even if I think some are ill-advised. She saved up and bought herself a Peloton two months ago; I told her how cool I thought it was and how I knew she was going to have a ton of fun on it. It’s become a clothing rack in our living room. She has a lot of designer bags and clothes that are really nice. But, she’s a tad bit reckless and has stained or tarnished things worth thousands of dollars. I strictly never say anything super critical about it because it’s her money.

But, for years she’s told me how boring she thinks my sports card collection is, but never expressed real hatred for it. Four years ago, it was worth $5-10,000 and was stuff I’d accumulated since I was a kid. I continued buying, and spent a lot of my “fun money” on my favorite player: Tom Brady. I would often refrain from buying expensive luxeries so I could save up for my Holy Grail: a Tom Brady Rookie Autograph. I purchased it in January 2019, and since then the market for cards has boomed.

My collection is now worth somewhere near $750,000, and I haven’t had any urge to stop adding to it. My fiancé thinks it’s time to just keep what I have and stop adding to it, because I “keep spending [my] ‘fun money’ on pieces of cardboard in plastic holders.” She brought this up when we were just chatting about our days in the living room. I told her I spent $6,000 on an extremely rare Tom Brady card, and she seemed taken aback. When I brought up how I don’t criticize her “fun money” spending, she asked what there was to criticize. So, I told her basically what I stated above.

I didn’t even think it was turning into anything major until she stormed off after I stopped my sentence. I followed her into the kitchen and asked if something I said was offensive, and she told me that I was being financially irresponsible for “investing in such a stupid concept” and “misunderstanding the meaning of having ‘fun money.’” She personally believes I should sell the whole thing and set us up for a stable retirement with a more traditional investment portfolio, but also said she’d never pressure me to do that. The discussion ended with her deciding to sleep in the guest room tonight. 

I only think I might be an asshole because having such a money-heavy hobby can seem extremely risky, but I also believe that since it’s my “fun money” I should be able to do whatever I want with it as long as I’m still contributing financially to our relationship and our future. AITA?

Edit: Just adding that everything is insured, properly documented, and organized. I plan on talking to my fiancé after work specifically about my card hobby and what she thinks about it. If she’s serious about wanting me to have a giant sell-off to fund our 20s, I have to seriously consider if she’s the type of person I can trust with serious amounts of money, whether that’s in savings or in something physical like cards. I’m genuinely not looking forward to it because I have a bad feeling she’s looking for the huge lump sum of funds right now.",0,Male,original

My boyfriend (25M) has been learning English for a while. I (25F) have lived and studied in an English speaking country for a good number of years so I’m fully fluent. Lately, he’s been taking his learning more seriously and will switch to English in the middle of our conversations to practice. The expectation is that I play a teacher role, replying in English and pointing out any mistakes. 

I don’t mind scheduling time to practice with him occasionally, but I hate teaching and switching to English considerably lowers the quality of our interactions. I always prefer to speak to him in our mother tongue and have asked him not to start randomly speaking to me in English. 

He’s very hurt because he thinks I’m not supporting him in something that’s very important to him and very low effort for me (his words). My unwillingness also makes him feel “like an idiot” since he thinks I’m indirectly saying that he’s slow and bad at the language. 

I told him there are plenty of people who are looking for a language exchange online he could leverage and he doesn’t have to practice with me because I don’t like being a teacher.

My m33 wife f27 lost her beloved dog carrot 2 months ago. It was devastating for her because he used to be her emotional support animal. He was her close friend and a source of comfort. My wife suffers from multiple mental health problems. She'd experience desppression and panic episodes several times regularly. She takes medication but it isn't doing much. She told me she wanted a new dog and wanted my help and I agreed to help her but while I was looking she already got a german shepard and named him ""Timmy"" or ""Tim"" which is my original name. I was puzzled when she said ""meet Tim, Timmy, Isn't he adorable?"". I was taken aback I asked if that wad his original name when she got him but she said no but she decided to give him this name. I was upset but kept my mouth shut but she started introducing him to friends and family and say Tim and Timmy. People several times got confused asking ""oh you talking about Timmy the dog or Timmy your husband?"". I felt awful as my name  being mixed up with the dog's name constantly. My friends and inlaws took this opportunity to laugh at me and make the topic of their funny conversations. It extended to the social media as well.


My wife yesterday posted that today was Timmy's birthday. I started getting confused calls from work and even people who didn't know me that well that it was my birthday. I found out about the post and blew up telling my wife that naming her dog after me was disrespectful and just wrong. She argued that she really likes the name and that it ""fits him"" but I said that this was ridiculous and she needed to change the name asap and save me from further humiliation. She refused and I insisted she then began crying saying I clearly don't care about how Timmy's helping her feel better after Carrot's death and that I was too selfish focusing on a name rather than her happiness. She kept avoiding me while constantly shouting out ""Tim"" and ""Timmy"" then say she meant to call the dog.

My mom suggested we get another dog but I know my wife got attached to this Timmy and would raise hell if I suggested that she replace it. She's refusing to stop and says I'm overreacting and my inlaws think I should stop whinning and be supportive. AITA?",0,Male,original
"My ex gave me a bunch of his clothes throughout the time we were dating. We recently broke up and the breakup was pretty toxic to say the least. I want nothing to do with him and recently have blocked all contact with him. In all the time he was able to have contact with me, he never asked for the clothes back. 

Now I just have them sitting in my closet and do not want them there as reminder of him anymore so I would like to get rid of them. I do not want to have to see him to give them back, and after all the shit he has put me through I don’t really think he deserve them back. I don’t want fo just throw them away, so I thought donating them would be a nicer option, but am I still the asshole?

"Okay so a little backstory. Before I met and moved in with my fiancé, I had a Bernese mountain dog mix named Harley. She’s now about three years old. We also have two cats, the three of them all get along great. 

The other day while we were driving home, we saw a dog abandoned on the side of the road. We saved it, thinking we were going to take her to the shelter the next day when it opened. But my fiancé now has his heart set on keeping this dog. 

She’s some type of Rottweiler I think, she has an injured ear, is underweight, and very obviously has been abused. 

That being said, Harley and this dog do not get along at all. We tried introducing them slowly, walking them together, feeding them separately, etc. They are fighting all the time, to the point where I am now even scared of this dog (and I’m a diehard dog person so this is saying something).  The cats have pretty much stayed away and not come inside for anything but their dinner. (We live in a rural area where outside indoor cats are the norm, we need them to keep mice away but I also love them?)

I’ve tried sharing my feelings, but he is convinced I’m just being anxious and that  facing my anxieties is the “only way to grow” but it feels like more than to me. 

I’d be willing to compromise and get another dog as long as it isn’t this dog! We can take my dog to the shelter to see who she gets on with or try to find a puppy. 

WIBTA if I take my dog and myself to stay at my moms until he agrees to get rid of this dog?

"To be fair, I’ve always been a little picky about the phone. Ever since I’ve met my now wife she’s been addicted to her phone. Either constantly on social media or texting her family/friends, or just general use. It bothers me because it doesn’t matter what we’re doing, she’s never really in the moment. 
We’ve recently had a baby and coupled with the pandemic her family is on overdrive with face time, we’re talking any time of the day they feel like calling they will. What makes it worse is that she will pickup no-matter-what when they call, and only them. Texts and calls from friends and other family she will ignore but her immediate family is an automatic answer no matter what is going on at the moment. 
Recently there have been two instances where her family has called while we’re in the middle of a conversation, and both times I was in the middle of a thought or sentence, and she has picked up the phone. This has made me feel pretty shitty as I feel like I can’t hold her attention or that she prioritizes them over me. 
I explained to her that I’d like her to be in the moment with me more. That their calls have never been pressing and I would just want her to at least wait to call or text them back after our conversation. This of course struck a cord with her and now she claims she I’ve given her anxiety about the phone ringing in my presence, even if we aren’t conversing. I’ve tried to explain and clarify over and over again that I just want her to at least finish our conversation and not allow them to be disruptive, but I can’t help but feel like an asshole because in her eyes I’m being controlling and triggered her anxiety.

"My husband(65M) and I(47F)have been married for 19 years. I’ve always done virtually 100% of the housework. Even though we both worked full time. Although I did stay home after my daughter was born. He retired a few months ago, and so I expected him to do more housework since he would be home all the time. But he hasn’t. I only specifically asked if he’d pick up the groceries from now on though. 


After talking to him about it. He agreed to start. I thought it was great. And was kind of shocked. He was suddenly doing all the cleaning and cooking by the time I got home. He was going to the grocery store and doing the laundry. 


But then I recently discovered that he’s just been having my 17 yo daughter do it. I guess I should’ve known since he went from having never used a stove, to suddenly cooking these beautiful dinners. 


I only found out cause my husband told me he had got everything from the grocery store. But my daughter told me they were out of Coke’s when *she* went. I asked her about it and she said that her father had told her that I asked him to pick up some of the chores. And so he had her do it. 


She said that I was being unreasonable for being upset and that that’s just how he is. But I don’t think I am. I’ve been falling over myself thanking him for the things I’ve done for 20 years. And I feel like an idiot.

"When I (23) got with my now ex partner, I already had a 3 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Honestly, raising my daughter as a young, since mother is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I've been able to come out of the experience as a better person. After I moved in with my ex partner, I also had my second daughter, who is now 2. I also have a 17 year old cat, who I found on the street, and who I was able to nurse back to full health.

Despite my hard work, which involved caring for my children and my cat, my ex never seemed to have time for me, since he worked as a doctor in a hospital. I understand that this is a somewhat stressful job, but as his partner and the mother to one of his children, he seemed to prioritise relaxation over investing in spending time with me. I'd be lucky if I had a few hours with him in a week. In short, this was never going to work.

During our breakup, it was agreed by the courts that I would get to live in the house with my daughters and my cat until my youngest daughter moved out. My ex didn't take this news kindly to say the very least. From what I know, he's currently having to share an apartment in the city to keep a roof over his head, even though he makes £70,000 a year, so he could easily afford a nice place in London.

Which brings us to our current situation. My ex informed me that couldn't look after his children for the weekend, due to ""work commitments."" I told him that his children want to see him, so he should make time for them. He snapped at me, and basically went off about how I'd stolen his dream home from him and effectively upended his life, despite the fact that he got the house from his parents after they retired to Portugal, so I'm failing to understand his point. I'd be lying if I said this didn't anger me, so I made a Facebook post calling him out for undermining my work as a mother and the fact that he couldn't make time for his children.

My parents see no problem in my post, but my brother tried telling me that I need to take the post down, since it ""isn't making me look as good as I think it does."" We got into an argument, and we haven't spoken since. Despite my ex's actions, I'm thinking that I may have gone too far by posting my feelings on Facebook, despite them being warranted.

The main issue is that I showed up in a t shirt( blank t-shirt), jeans, a quarter zip sweater( a pricey one btw), and Kobe Nikes( not dirty), while everyone else was dressed up. My wife was very upset that I chose to "" dress like a college kid"" to her company event. She actually pulled me off to the side during this event and lectured me about my attire.

 Maybe it's worth mentioning, maybe not, but, in the mid-sized town I grew up in, my folks were pretty prominent figures, and, for me, that meant a lot of dressing up as a kid, which, I hated, and I guess subconsciously I vowed to avoid dressing up as much as I could when I grew up. Luckily, the company I work for is big into WFH, and when we do meet up, its t shirt and jeans.

I don’t know what her obsession with throwing parties is but this is the 3rd party this year she’s thrown. The other two failed horribly. Her first one only 2 people showed up for a birthday and second one she tried throwing for a birthday no one could come and it ended up being canceled few days before. This time she’s inviting a bunch of random people ages 20-60+ for them to just swing by, eat, and do what they want. It’s said nothing is formal but they are welcome to swing by and hand out candy to kids at her new house she had gotten. I felt this was just a party for herself to show off her new house since the other two didn’t work out. She’s invited the same group of people so I’m not quite sure how this is going to work... 

One of my best friends I’ve known since first grade told me they had just planned his bachelor party a couple days after my gf sent that text but they’re both on the same date. I told my friend that I would be going to his party even though my gf had given me notice of her party first. I feel this “party” is going to be another fail or canceled last minute and will just be me and her sitting in her house.

"Edit: I will not be getting a dog anytime soon. Our apartment was approved for dogs of a certain size, so nobody has to get concerned. It’s more just to see if I’m really in the wrong here. 

A week before I (23f) met my boyfriend (26m) I adopted a puppy who has since been a member of our family. We love dogs, I come from a background where love our dogs and have owned many, and he appears to have the same mindset without even ever owning any. 
Dog training and dog care has been a passion of mine ever since I met him. My plan is to own a ton of dogs someday, just like my parents do. 
I live in a one bedroom apartment that I pay for. My boyfriend lives with me, and I’ve only asked him to cover a bill or two and help with chores seeing as he doesn’t work a lot. 
We split taking care of our dog, one of us walks her in the morning, one of us at night. She’s very easy going and I think could really benefit from having another dog in the home. 
My boyfriend doesn’t want a dog until spring, because he wants to be graduated from college before we get another dog. While that is fair, I work really hard for the things I have, animal work is a passion of mine, and considering I would have to pay for it anyway, I did the math and have enough that if the right dog came along I could easily and comfortably afford it. 
In preparation for wanting to add another dog to the home, I signed up to meet with an adoption agency, as it usually takes 6 months to get approved. However, we were able to get approved just yesterday. He was a part of the process. My boyfriend sat down with me and picked the dogs we were interested in potentially meeting. 
Well, as we just started to get messages tonight about meeting up with the fosters of the dogs we pick, he told me that “it’s not a good time right now and that we need to wait”. He also said “we agreed on spring” so he wants to honor that.
I was pretty mad. I put in the work, I pay for everything, and he tells me that he doesn’t want it anymore. I feel like he strung me along, helping me pick out which dogs we wanted to see. 
He told me I was acting like a spoiled child who wasn’t getting her way. This was something I had my heart set on, something I worked hard for, but I feel like he’s toying with me.

"BF(m/22) and I (f/19) both come from immigrant families but our situations are very different. my parents (mid 40s) immigrated as teens, integrated very well, built a great life for themselves & our family is well off financially and socially. 

BF’s family is a bit different; they came to this country about 4 years ago and BF (younger son) has adapted the best.

they don’t have a lot of money so both sons live with their parents to support them. parents don’t work but attend language courses daily. father is sadly suffering with multiple health conditions.

his parents aren’t very independent: e.g. they can’t make their own appointments due to the language barrier etc. I started making appointments for them and found a translator so FIL could see an expert.

the problem is his mom.

she is the same age as my mom, but she seems to not be able to do anything on her own.

just a few weeks ago she waited for BF to come home and drive her to water her friend’s plants (friend was on vacation), instead of walking on her own for 10min.

I love her a lot and she loves me a lot, but it does get on my nerves.

I'm not used to it: if my mom wants to spend a weekend in another city, she’ll organize everything herself but MIL can’t even ride the bus to her doctor.

this is putting a strain on our relationship since it further clogs up BF’s busy schedule (fulltime job + daily sports practice).

even when we went on vacation (1 week, first vacation alone) she called daily and sent 20min voice messages every morning (nothing important happened, she also does this when he sleeps over) which really got on my nerves.

I sent my parents some updates and pictures and called my dad (only week we could get off was his birthday week). we were gone for ONE week!!!

he noticed that I was annoyed and we got into an argument, but it stopped before there was any  conclusion.

he said that family is a priority for him (implying that it isn’t for me???).

he spends a lot of his nights helping his mom with her homework instead of his own or sleeping. I feel like I’m the only one concerned for his health/future (e.g. MIL asked him to help her prep food at night when he was clearly sick and needed rest, I told him over text that it can wait and he should sleep, he said she can’t do it alone).

I’m afraid that she’ll turn into a overbearing MILs once we get married (we plan to get married after I graduate uni in 3-4 years). BF has promised that she’ll mind her own business but I’m not so sure about that.

I know how awful MIL’s can be (best example: my paternal grandmother) and I don’t want to suffer like my mom.

I personally plan to take care of my own parents, once they are too old to do so themselves but to my parents the most important thing is that I have a good future. I do a lot of household chores, since I’m currently still living with my parents but they’d never ask me to clean the whole house when they know I have an exam coming up (not the same but it’s about the principle).

"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together for a little over 2 years. He's genuinely an awesome person and we are really happy together.

One of the only things about him that bothers me is that he loves me the way I am right now, meaning he doesn't really want me to change anything about myself.
It's not that he forbids me anything, but he makes it clear that he's not happy with certain things. 

This happened once so far, but it was a pretty big deal to him. That time I went to get my nails done, which I normally don't really do but I wanted it for once. I didn't tell him about it because I didn't think it was a big deal, but turns out he finds longer nails really creepy (they were like medium long) and kind of didn't want me to touch him with the nails. Imo opinion he overreacted, but if I had told him beforehand he could have told me about this.
So I took them off. (Bye $50)

Now I really want a piercing and a tattoo.
I already had 2 earrings on each side and a tattoo that covers my whole left thigh when we got together, and he never had a problem with them.
About 6 months ago I told him I would want to get another tattoo at some point, and he said he didn't really understand why I would get another one. He didn't say he was opposed to it but I know he kinda is.

Fast forward to this week. I made an appointment to get the tragus piercing I've wanted for a long time and I'm getting it next week. I've also had a tattoo idea in my head to honour / remind me of my dad and I've decided I want to schedule an appointment with an artist.

I haven't told my boyfriend about the piercing appointment or my plans to get the tattoo because I'm scared he'll react the same way as with the nails.
While I think it would be hypocritical for him to have a problem with it, since I already have a big thigh tattoo and ear piercings, I still think it could be an asshole move to just do it without telling him.

WIBTA for doing this?


Edit 1: So lots of people think I should talk to him about wanting the piercing and tattoo before getting them. If he doesn't accept / respect my decision or tries to change my mind I should explain that I still have bodily autonomy and he is allowed to dislike my decision, but I'm still doing it.

I'm planning on having this conversation this evening with him. I'll update asap. Thanks for all the replies!

Edit 2: Okay so I talked to him last night and he didn't take it great but not really bad either.
I told him that I was getting a tragus piercing and that I have an appointment on Monday to get it done with a good friend of mine.
I also asked him if he remembered me talking about getting a tattoo for my dad (about 6 months ago), and told him I had decided I wanted to get it, although no appointments have been made yet.

His first reaction was - as I expected - ""but why would you do that?"" and ""it's not necessary"". I proceeded to explain to him that I really want them and it'll make me happy, to which he replied ""will it?"". 
I also told him that he is allowed to not like these kinds of changes, but that I still want to be able to do them and I won't change as a person because I make a change in my appearance. 

I think he got the message, saying ""I guess I'll have to live with them [the tattoo and piercing] but I won't love you less.""
He acted kinda sad during the conversation yesterday, but he was / is still affectionate and I'm positive once I have them he'll get over it.

Thank you for your judgement and advice!",0,Female,original
"AITA Hi me(22 )and my bf (21)of four years recently went and saw his mother. We were all sitting outside talking when his cousin who's 16 f says she got in trouble at school for calling a kid a beaner she said the reason she did it was because they called her white chocolate I know not really anything to get offended by and isn't that normally used sexually. They make jokes and laugh about it but I didn't .I spoke up and said why would you go to their level and say something like that. His mother stopped me and says ""it doesn't hurt anyone"" well it hurt me to hear that my boyfriends family says racists thing since my dad is a Mexican and it hurt even more that my boyfriend didn't care. When we got home I told his I was disappointed and he started making excuses from the start he defended his cousin saying ""she's a kid"" she's 16 she knows what being a racists is
Update: he came back and apologized ""for being a racists asshole and not thinking about my feelings or my father's feelings""
Update 2: the cousin wasn't getting sexually harassed the other student who called her white chocolate was another female student who has been messing with her for a while",0,Female,original
"An idea that I'm seriously debating mostly because I think it'd be funny, but also, useful.

I (29, F) am getting married to my fiance (30, M) in two weeks.

One of my pet peeves is when people other than the bride wear white to weddings.  In the US - especially midwest (if you're not from here), this is a well-known NO NO, and it's seen as disrespectful.

We were at a family wedding a couple weekends ago, and I noticed two family members that are also attending our wedding wearing white (probably closer to cream) pantsuit and dress.

The issue is, they play dumb so they act like they haven't heard basic wedding etiquette.

My solution to this is to buy cheap bright green t-shirts and write in a sharpie ""I wore white to the wedding"", and so my wedding coordinator can hand them out to any guests breaking this ""rule"".

It's funny in theory, but idk if I can go through with it because it seems like I'm a bit of a bridezilla if someone actually has to wear it.

"So my BF and I are in a long distance relationship because of school and his birthday is at the end of this month. He's turning 20 which is a big milestone and we got a really fancy dinner and hotel experience together for my 20th which I obviously wouldn't celebrate without him.

Thing is that when he got home from his last visit he informed me that he will be going home to his family for his birthday party cause he agreed to have a joint party with his 2 siblings and he said he didn't tell me in person because he didn't want me to get upset. Now this would be fine and all if it wasn't for the fact that I cannot stand his brother, much less the gf and friends he would be bringing and my BF is very aware of this meaning he knew it would be a celebration without me if he agreed to it.

He's now making me sound like the bad guy for not wanting to go (it's a 2+ hours travel one way even if I did, also expensive) even though he already knew that would be the case when he agreed to it. I feel like these big milestones is something you wouldn't dream of celebrating without your SO so I'm feeling very hurt by all of this, especially the lack of empathy from his side. It makes me feel like I care about doing things together more than he does and I don't know where that puts me.",1,Female,original
"My wife (32F) and I (34M) had a complicated start to our relationship. She was still in a relationship with her ex (32M) when we met and first became intimate but she *did not* cheat on him. As a result, when she became pregnant with Ava, he denied all knowledge and relationship to the child and insisted it was mine even with all evidence to the contrary (to put it bluntly: different races).

My wife and I have been together for nine years now. We have three children: a son from my previous relationship, Ava, and one little girl together. Ava is now eight years old and she knows that I am not her biological dad. We have tried to be as open with Ava as is appropriate for her age and for her curiosity about her father, but she plainly isn't curious about his identity. My wife has never pursued her ex for child support or money or anything. When he got married a few years ago, he told us he did not want Ava to ever get in touch with him and told me that I adopted her on the condition that she never consider him or look for him as her father.

For Ava's eighth birthday, my wife put up pictures of her party up on Facebook, and her ex's sister (Ava's aunt) got in contact with her to ask after Ava and gently hint that their mother (Ava's grandmother) would love to meet and get to know her, given the chance. We spoke to Ava about it, and she was interested, so she and her grandmother have had a few lunches together and are starting to develop a relationship.  However, the last time we went to Ava's grandmother's house, my wife's ex was waiting outside and started an argument about us breaking our agreement by having Ava in his childhood home and spending time with his family. 

However, in my opinion, he has no role to play in any of this - Ava is getting to know her grandmother, and that has nothing to do with him, even though that is his mother. AITA?",0,Male,original

"AITA? so for background, i’m 25 weeks pregnant and i’ve been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum so i am literally throwing up or sick almost all the time. it’s especially bad at night and last night was very rough. my boyfriend who is normally super supportive and wonderful, takes about 30-45 minute poops in the morning. 

so this morning i was feeling horrible and he was in our bathroom. i tried to wait but i ended up having to throw up. i ended up going to my roommates bathroom to throw up. his bathroom isn’t in his room like ours is but at the end of our hallway next to our roommates room. when my boyfriend came out of the bathroom he said something along the lines of “idk why you didn’t just tell me to wrap it up and probably woke up our roommate” and made me feel really guilty for throwing up in that bathroom. for reference, it was about 4am. i honestly did not have time for him to wrap it up because i had already almost threw up on the floor trying to get to a bathroom. i also do not particularly want to put my face next to a toilet he was just taking a poop on. 

i honestly get that it’s early and i didn’t want to wake him up but it was an emergency. i did get upset with my boyfriend after this and said something like “yeah i gotta throw up so f me right” which i do believe was a little out of line. i am just miserable, pregnant, and sick. our roommate is also super chill and understanding. i’m sure if he was woken up and knew it was because i was sick, he wouldn’t be upset. AITA for not waiting for him to be done or telling him to wrap it up? or AITA for being upset that my boyfriend seemed to care more about our roommate waking up than me being sick?  

TLDR: i’m pregnant and dealing with morning sickness and my boyfriend takes super long poops. i had to throw up in our roommates bathroom and my boyfriend made me feel like shit about it because it could have (but didn’t) woken up our roommate.",0,Female,original
"Hi All.  Long time Redditer, throwaway for this one.  OK, been with my girlfriend for 5 years.  Super great relationship, until now.  Both over 45, ok, maybe one of us is 50ish+.  She had a birthday comming up on Wednesday, let's say on week 2.  Problem is, I knew that I had a 6 hour redeye flight, plus timezone change, to take on the Monday of week 2, all day meetings on Tuesday, and then a 6 hour redeye back, plus timezone change, on Wednesday morning, which would be her birthday.  I knew I was going to be trashed from the travel travel schedule.  So, I planned ahead, on week 1, the week before her birthday, we went out on friday, nice new jewelry present, painted the town, stayed at a hotel friday to saturday just to escape the race and everything that goes with that.  Had a great time.  

Got on the flight, came home wednesday, trashed as exptected, barely got my ass out of bed, and, yup, forgot to say happy birthday on her actually f\*cking birthday.   Then, the next day, she brought it up, as a weapon, and I was wrecked.  I could not believe that I actually missed it, especially after all the planning in advance.  It was not good, and I was upset and appologetic.  Since then, it's been like an ice storm around here.  Keep in mind I was a frigg'n zombie on the important day.  

I'm also a bit upset that she didn't protect the relationship from this.  I obviously planned a great birthday in advance because I knew I was going to be trashed from the travel.  All she had to do was playfully say, at the end of the day, ""is there anything you want to tell me before we go to sleep tonight?""  I would have triggered, and all would have been good.  But, no, she let it ride, stewed on it, and then sprang it after the fact.  OK, the reality is, I missed the day, have to own that, I get it.  But, I'm not happy about this part.  I also have'nt brought it up, does'nt feel right.  

Still ice around here.  

I'm at the point where I'm ready to let her do her thing.  If she wants to warm up and come back, I'm open arms.  If she wants to ice what was a great thing over this, the door is over there.  Hav'nt said that yet, but that's the feeling.  I just don't see how I can save this myself.

"Me (16 female) and my girlfriend (17 female) have been dating for around 2 years now. Recently she has met a new person that she considers her friend (17 female) who I do not like. Soon after they met (less then a week) this friend confesses to my girlfriend that she has a crush on her, to which my girlfriend declined saying she has me. After that her friend tries to break us up and cuases issues in our relationship, but my girlfriend is still friends with her. Her friend soon gets a girlfriend and I thought it would all be over. Nope. My girlfriend was supposed to come over to my place to help me with some schoolwork but she never shows and doesnt answer her phone at all. I wait for her outside (in low 40 degree weather) for an hour and a half. After she finally answeres, I find out she was with this friend and decided not to show up to my place. Also to note, she never told anyone where she was. I got messages and calls from her family and friends trying to find her aswell. She told me her friend was going through something and she was helping her not get in too much trouble, I understand but am obviously upset. I let it go though. The day after her friend goes around spreading rumors about my girlfriend and is really shitty to her for the next 2 WEEKS. And then came crying to my girlfriend saying sorry and my girlfriend took her back, completly ignoring my request for her not to (she stayed up crying at nights over this girl being an ass to her). This happens over and over again and is continueing to get in the way of our relationship. They act like they are dating most of the time. I know the girl her friend is dating and it turns out neither of us like their friendship and have both told them this. Today, my girlfriend and her friend were inseparable. She had just told me they are no longer friends, and then I walk into the bathroom with them in the stall together. I told her to chose between us. She said she wouldnt. AITA?

"Some background:

My Husband (36) and I (F31 currently 5 months pregnant with baby #6) have had pets throughout our entire marriage so far. When we met he had a dog R who died  of old age shortly after our oldest child turned 6 months. We have had our cat J since he found her at a stable he worked at the summer before we got married. Once we bought our first house and our 3rd baby was 6months we bought two dogs Y and B. In 2020 he was working on site and found a small black kitten huddled under equipment trying to keep warm in the freezing Feb. temperatures. We brought him home, our then 3 (now 5) year old fell in love with him and E became my sons cat. They slept together at night, he helped feed him and generally took care of E. He is the sweetest cat ever.

Now to the problem;

I told my husband that as the pets pass away and leave our home, I didn't want any more pets.  J, who is now old, sick and generally failing in health. We started a discussion this summer about getting J put down due to her health issues and quality of life. Her meds are extensive and expensive, she can't make it to any of the litter boxes (we have over 5 in the house) and i can't keep cleaning up her messes. Her quality of life is so minimal. We have set an appointment to have her released from this life. We are letting her go this weekend.

Unfortunately E got out three weeks ago, and hasn't come home. I have put up flyers all over the neighborhood, posted on several facebook groups locally and hit all the nearby humane societies every time I see a cat that looks like E. I have even checked their DOA reports from animal control in hope of some closure. All to no avail. E has either been taken by a wild animal or someone picked him up and isn't giving him back. He was never meant to be outside ever so we never microchipped him (which i now regret) with all this online and in person visiting of the humane society, i have come across several cats who look just like E, but are not him. Our shelters are overwhelmed here.

My son dearly misses his cat, he asks form almost every night, and now with putting J down I suddenly find myself Catless, which I didn't expect to happen so suddenly or like this. I know what I said about not getting any more pets, but I have found myself suddenly depressed over all this. I want to take my son to the humane society and let him pick a new kitten. I acknowledge that thesis a knee-jerk reaction to our situation and that my pregnancy hormones are probably playing huge role.

WIBTA if I took son to get another kitten? My husband hasn't flat out said no to it, but we can't agree on the type of cat to get, which is why I would let our son choose.

(I am aware of the Pet tax, unfortunately I cannot share photos for privacy reasons with all the posts i have made looking for E I am worried someone will fully figure out who I am. I am looking to remain anonymous for many reasons.)",0,Female,original
"I (22f) lost over 100 pounds in the past 3 years. Because of this I have a lot of loose skin. I went to the doctor and she said I can have surgery to remove the skin on my stomach. This is very good news as the weight imbalance has been causing me back pain and inflammation for the past few months. My husband (22m) doesn’t want me to get it until 1 year later as he will be with me. We are not together now because of immigration delays. To be honest i was being annoying about doing the surgery in 3 months or so because i want to save money for essentials as moving to a different country it’s expensive. 
Now to the joke part, when i was trying to explain everything from my side all he said was “stop your drama.” It pissed me off because i don’t talk to anyone about my medical problems and rather than coming up with a compromise this is all i get. And he said he meant to use the word drama, I cut him off and said “yes it’s drama just like when u got sick was drama.” This made him angry as he “just wanted to act like my parents. And it was a joke and he was laughing” I don’t share anything with my parents because they always downplay or get angry at me. For example when the doctor diagnosed me with seasonal depression my dad yelled at me for telling the doctor stories. And it’s not like my husband doesn’t know this. I even said in the fight i don’t share anything with my parents because they say this, it’s my first time sharing a medical problem with you and if you act like this i will keep everything to myself. 
He called me selfish and a bad wife because always i call his jokes bullying and he will not like to come home because i always yell. Also he said he will stop caring. 
Now he is not talking to me. AITA?",0,Female,original
"As the title says. My husband and I share our finances. Pay equal towards the house. We have fun money but recently most of it is going towards household costs. We have individual Savings but not much. Our roof went out, I lost my job for three months but I got it back. We have been dipping into our savings to make ends meet.  We are finally getting a bit of breathing room now. 

BIL has a big dog that needs surgery for cancer I think. BIL doesn’t have all of the $, so he asked my husband for 5k. Husband mentioned casually during dinner that he was going to lend his brother that money. I kind of flipped because that’s half of our entire savings. What happens if we have a big unexpected cost? 

I told my husband that he can use money from his individual savings if he wants to pay his brother but not our household savings. He told me that he has less than $100 in his personal savings but that he supported me for three months and so technically a big chunk of the savings really were his. 

AITA because I am refusing to allow him to lend 5000 to his brother that we will probably never get back? His dog will have to be put down he says.

"I've been jogging and exercising more regularly because Heaven knows walking up stairs isn't getting any easier. This summer has been hotter than the devil's buttcrack but I've been out there doing the work.

My FIL needed help digging space for a new garden and my wife volunteered me to help. The morning of I went on a quick 2-mile jog, and since I was going to be gardening later I just decided to stay in the same shirt. My wife told me I needed to change because I stank (fair), and when I tried explaining that I didn't want to dirty another shirt she shouted me down. So I rescinded her offer for my help and stayed at home.

She claimed, after the argument, that it was because she didn't want to be in the car with me for an hour smelling like sweat (even though that's how I'd wind up smelling on the way back). She also said that her dad hurt his back because I wasn't there to help him, and he had to miss work.

"My (23M) boyfriend and I (24F) have been together for over two years. The first year we were long distance and last year he moved to my state and we began living together. 

He doesn’t have a job because he was able to save his salary from his job for the past 3 years. We also got a dog fairly soon after we moved in together. 

However, since we started living together over a year ago, he has just played his computer game all day long and chooses to prioritize it over myself and our dog. I have tried to talked to him about it numerous times and he always says he’s not addicted to it and I’m just making it up, etc. he refuses to believe it is not normal for him to play all day, everyday. 

When it comes to doing things around the house, he hardly helps unless I ask. And I am the one to make sure all the bills are paid on time, but he does pay for half of the bills. He grew up in a wealthy home so he never had to do these tasks. But his mom made sure he knew how to do them for when he got older. He also refuses to watch our dog alone. He says he doesn’t feel comfortable alone with him which really annoys me sometimes because I have a great work from home but can’t even watch him or watch him without complaining when I have important meetings because he claims he has to focus on his game. 

Tonight, we got in a fight after he said he can’t hangout with me because he has to play his game and he’s not going to go without playing his game for a day. I told him he was addicted to his game and it’s more important to him than our relationship and if he wants to go back to living at his parents house with no friends (other than his online friends) and no future then be my guest.  He then called me an AH and hasn’t spoken to me since. 

I kinda feel bad about what I said but I am getting fed up with his behavior. Am I the AH? 

I would be fine with him playing his game if he didn’t prioritize it over our relationship. That’s what upsets me the most. One night, I asked him if he had to choose between me or the game what would it be? He said he would never quit the game, hinting that he would rather break up.

Edit: He was a professional gamer for 3 years, when we met so I knew he liked to game but I never thought it would get to this point. Also, he plays Runescape. I have talked/vented to his mom about it because she completely agrees and has tired to talk about it and he doesn’t listen to her either. He believes we’re all against him. He has made comments about me acting like his mom before. Where I’ve told him, I in no way want to act like his mom but when he can’t do simple things like take the trash out, put the right things in the recycle bin, or do things in a timely manner then he forces me to ask him to do this things. If he would help vacuum or empty the dishwasher, etc. without he asking numerous times then I wouldn’t have to act like his mom.

"I (27F) am currently engaged to H (27M), my partner of >5 years. H is South Asian and I am Latina.

&#x200B;

In the time that I've been with H, his parents (60M, 59F) have shown themselves to be very cruel to him. Every break, holiday, or weekend visit to H's parents' home always ends in a big fight with H's father constantly threatening to kick him out.

&#x200B;

When we first got engaged in late 2019, we planned on not asking for financial support for our wedding ceremony and reception. Together, we could afford a nice, little wedding with the people we truly cared about and all the bells and whistles we wanted. Unfortunately, H's parents pressured us to invite so many more people than we were financially able to afford. In the 18 COVID month pause, H's parents insisted that if we were to ask them for money for the wedding, they would call the shots. They wanted us to do a traditional South Asian wedding. My Catholic traditions would be restricted to having a short prayer during the signing of paperwork.

&#x200B;

A couple of months ago, all these plans fell apart when we found out that H's parents were pressuring us to do emotional labor (being the go-between during the many family fights, driving people around when they visited our city, accepting comments about my recent pandemic weight gain, etc) and they had not put down any deposits for our wedding.

&#x200B;

When H confronted his parents, they said horrible things about H, me, and my parents (56M, 54F). They said we were only looking to swindle them from their money. H's parents reasoned that they would not put down deposits until they met my parents. There were a few issues with that. 1) We were never told that deposits were contingent on this. 2) Our parents live over 200 miles apart. 3) in my culture, there is a specific wedding custom where the groom's family is invited over to the bride's family home to ask for the bride's hand. H's parents were informed about all of this and they decided they did not care.

&#x200B;

So we decided we did not care cancelled the wedding.

&#x200B;

Here is where I think I might be the asshole: H and his parents have not had much of a relationship since then. His parents text him daily that he is breaking their heart by not calling or texting back. Today is H's dad's birthday and we were supposed to go visit him for the weekend as a surprise. When H's father found out about the surprise, he texted H and forbid me from visiting for his birthday. He stated that I was disrespectful and was not a part of the family because I had not called when the family dog passed away recently.

&#x200B;

H's parents have now involved H's sister (22F). H's sister is texting us that she will stop having a relationship with us unless we fix this with H's parents. H's parents are blowing up our phones that they have been crying every day because of H and me. I also keep getting texts that I'm tearing their family apart.

&#x200B;

So AITA for tearing my partner's family apart?

UPDATE: I've seen your messages and comments about my obvious need to accept blame. I will bring this up during my regular therapy sessions this week. H and I have talked about this post and H is completely ready to go back to the NC state he was in before wedding planning became a fiasco. He states that he moved 1,000 miles from his parents because of their narcissism. We will be having a talk with H's sister this weekend.",0,Female,original

Every time M went home over college break, B would shoot her shot, even though she knew he was with me. M told me and politely shut her down and they drifted apart a little. They did still talk online some.  
A couple years after graduation, M and I got our first apartment together. One weekend I was traveling to visit family. B happened to be road tripping cross-country that weekend and asked M if she could stay at our place along the way.  
I had met B once at this point when we were in his hometown visiting family. She literally pushed me out of the way to fling herself in his arms.  
M asked me and I said no, I wasn’t comfortable with her staying in our apartment given that I was pretty sure she still had a thing for him and I wouldn’t be there.  
I’ve definitely had jealousy issues in the past, which are on me- M is amazing and attractive but has never given me any reason not to trust him. So AITA for not letting her stay at our place because I didn’t trust her?",0,Female,original
"Backstory: my boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been dating for almost 6 years. We met and started dating in college and overall we have a really good relationship. There is one reoccurring issue that arises and I want to see how other people view this issue. He’s always on my case saying I should go to the gym (he goes around 5-6x a week and really loves it). Me on the other hand? I fucking hate the gym and honestly even the thought of going there and working out kinda just pisses me off? I really can’t explain why but I just have never really gone to the gym and I’ve never liked it. (I’m still active and played sports it’s just like the gym and fitness related things). Here’s the thing though, the reason he wants me to go to the gym is so I can grow a bigger ass. Literally that’s what he says at this point, he makes backhanded comments about it sometimes that make me feel like shit about it and insecure but he justifies it by saying ‘it’s something that I have the ability to change’ But his comments have made me not want to go even more now because it’s just aggravating to me and I wouldn’t be doing it for myself I’d be doing it to please him. He says he wants me to be healthy too and stuff but I think it’s pretty clear his main concern is me growing a bigger ass. I’m 5’9 1/2 and I weigh around 118, I have a hyperactive thyroid so I have always been really skinny and by no means did I have more of an ass when we started dating than I do now? My body has stayed pretty much the same, and My stomach is toned so it’s not like I look unhealthy. Which is another thing that makes it hard for me to gain motivation because I am so skinny that if you saw me you would probably think I work out a lot based on my body frame, so it makes me feel like what’s the point of I already look the way I want without having to do anything? I admit that’s super lazy of me and I know that even though I am thin it’s still healthy to go to the gym so I don’t really need comments pushing that cause I get it but that’s not the issue here. Also to add, not trying to sound conceded at all, but for context I and others would consider myself to be very attractive and my boyfriend and I frequently get called ‘the hot couple’ and ‘goals’. So he’s got no other issues with my appearance and that’s annoying to me too, that me having a big ass is something he cares so much about when i have plenty of other good appearance features. Anyway, AITA for not going to the gym and not trying to make my ass bigger for my boyfriend or is he the asshole for pushing me to change my body and openly saying how flat it is in a shameful way because he wants it to look better?",0,Female,original
"So some context
My GF has a job and she needs to move to LA in the next 2 weeks. Shes been putting off moving while I find a job. I have been furiously applying everywhere and to everything and just getting destroyed by No’s. I have exhausted all my connections and friends.
I actually gave myself an ulcer earlier in the summer from the stress

I keep looking and getting close but so far nothing. My current job is with a family friend and tied to a location 


My Gf and I attended a wedding over the weekend. During the rehearsal she was on her phone working. She commented how she hated her job and how she needs to find something better. Another bridesmaid who she barely knows said hey i could pass your resume along at my company 



So i only got a little info from her that night and I was like yea that’s great go for it.


So last night she said she has a phone interview. I am like that’s so great.
Do you think you could ask her for me to maybe help me get a role or pass me along?

She goes umm well what do you want?

I was like well anything in this category. She was like well look on the site. I did before I texted her. I was like okay I didn’t know that. I assumed the other bridesmaid knew of a role.

Then we get into a mini fight over it and it ends with

She didn’t ask you she asked me.

Then we go around in circles for a bit and I was like well don’t you think if she knew I was looking and needed to move cause you are pressuring me to move she would have made the same offer. Like I wasn’t in the wedding. So when I spoke to this women it was just what ever the group was talking about.


Some further context when my gf started her most recent role I said hey your company has a role Id be good for do you think you could help me. We hashed it out and she said she didnt want work at the same company which makes sense 



But this is different cause its a field shes never worked in. She’s very big in working in a field she loves. So this newer role would only be until she finds a role in her desired industry 


Whereas I am just trying to get a job to be out in LA with her.

The only reason I relented on moving to LA without a job was cause was gonna sign a lease without me. But this Job she is trying to leave is also the reason she is moving out there. Now she is saying I can just come out when im ready


I think if anything we are both the asshole.
Maybe I shouldn’t have asked but also I prefaced it with I would apply to a different role and different dept or region since its remote

But also i just feel helpless and stressed in this job search and need to explore all avenues to be in LA with her",1,Male,original
"Situation-

My bf works night shift (11pm-7am, remote) and I work day shift (I have to drive to work). I understand he has to talk to people for his job and just to vent with his friends/coworkers. My issue is that aside from his daily meetings with his shift team, he talks a lot with his friends. He would talk with them for over 2 hours before his meeting just to vent and discuss anything important for work, but mostly to vent. He talks loud and it feels like none of them ever wants to end the call. And then after the calls, my bf would go about with the meeting, which by then is past 2am. It really disrupts with my sleep schedule, especially I have to get up by 6:30 for work.

When I complain about it, he thinks I'm unreasonable and even says I'm jealous cause his friends happen to be females. Is not like I want to complain, I just wish he can see from my side. When I sleep, he's working and some noises, aside from his calls, are unpreventable, which wakes me up. When he's done with work in the morning, I have to go to work. He has the house to himself and can sleep in. 

So am I unreasonable to complain or even just to voice my frustration?",0,Female,original
"Me (21M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for around a year. We had this break in between but long story short, I tried getting over her by forgetting everything that happened between us and forgetting her. A few days ago, she asked me if she remembered what she wore for our first date and I genuinely couldn't remember off the top of my head. It made her extremely upset and I understood why and I feel horrible. I'm an extremely forgetful person and I never remember small things like that. AITA?",0,Male,original
"I am a 20f and I told my boyfriend that I didn’t like his jokes about my appearance because they made me feel bad and they weren’t funny. Yesterday, I told him I thought I was not enough for him. So I was feeling very insecure about myself. Today he jokingly told me why I was acting like I was hot and guys thirst for me. I told him I didn’t like the jokes he made about my appearance because it made me feel bad especially after what I told him yesterday. He started to say that he didn’t know that would affect me and that now he can’t be himself around me and has to walk on eggshells! I never said that though I just don’t like those kind of jokes. I don’t understand why he would say that. He then said he doesn’t have energy for this conversation and that he would talk to me later because it seemed we were getting into an argument.",0,Female,original
"I (22F) am from Eastern Europe and 4 years ago I moved to Sweden to study medicine, a program taught entirely in swedish. When I started the program I met my boyfriend (22M) and we had really great chemistry together. On out first date he tried to talk to me in english since swedish was not my first language but I really wanted to overcome the language barrier so I asked ""Can we talk only in swedish?"".  I don't know why but he understood that I have no ability to speak english even though I did not hide the fact that I graduated from IB (the program though entirely in English). A year later we moved in together and a month ago he started talking in english with his friends whenever I was around. At firsts I didn't pay any attention to that but later I overheard something. One of his friends who's is also a boyfriend of my dear friend started talking about girls he met at the bar last week. I couldn't be quiet about that so I told my friend. She deserves to know that. Next morning my boyfriend started shouting at me that I am a liar and I made him seem like a fool in front of his friends. I tried to explain that I never told him that I don't speak english but he doesn't listen. 
I love him and I don't want to lose him but I really don't feel like I should apologize. AITA?",0,Female,original
"TLDR: Im the litter box cleaner because of a deal a made to get my second cat. Didn't realize I would be leaving for almost a year and my husband will have to do it. I'm thinking of getting my husband one of those robotic litter boxes for Christmas. I don't want it to be a getting your wife a vacuum for Christmas type deal. WIBTA?

When I married my husband he had 1 cat, basically his soul cat. He said that when she passes we won't get another cat because noone could live up to her. He knew I was in vet med and that statement probably wouldn't told true for long. When he was deployed last year we had a cat come in that owners wanted to euthanize due to an injured tail and a guarded prognosis. Well I fell in love with him and asked my husband if we could bring him home. He agreed only if I would take over litter box duty. He absolutely hated doing it for 1 cat and he knew he would hate it with another. (Also, we split household duties evenly before anyone says he wanted out of a chore) I had no problem with this at all. Our second cat was signed over to me and I brought him home a week later. 

Husband comes back home, loves our new derp cat and the added benefit of not doing litter boxes anymore. Fast forward a few months and I find out I will be deploying for 10ish months next year. This means husband will be taking care of all the household tasks, including litter boxes, while I'm gone. 

I spoke with some friends that had robotic litter boxes and they speak nothing but good things about them. I'm worried that if I get him a $500 gift that is really just for the cats then I would be the AH. Is this basically like getting your wife a vacuum cleaner for  Christmas? I typically do homemade gifts or experiences for him. Would this be a shitty (ha) gift to give him right before I leave? Is it better to just consider it a household purchase and not a gift?",1,Female,original

"I (28F) have been in a relationship with an Indian guy (29M) who migrated here to the US for his doctorate research. His parents have also migrated and live with him, which I find odd. We met in college 1 year ago and have been relationship for nearly 2 months.1 week back, I asked if I can meet his parents and visit his home. He was fine with the idea.  
Upon arrival, I saw a little swastika on their front door which seriously freaked me out. I asked about it and was told that this symbol is used in their home country as a sign of good luck and prosperity. I suggested taking it down as for me, it is a sign of hate. Even though he was kind of upset, he said he can remove it and place it somewhere else, but won't throw it out.   
His parents were very nice to me, but when I asked where will they live in near future, they stared at me with a blank expression. Then my bf said what I mean by that. I told him that if we move together, it would be very weird with his parents around. I was then told that in his culture, parents live with their kids till death. So he won't be moving them away from his house. I can either accept his culture or find our separate ways. At that point, I was already very upset, not only by the swastika but also by how he valued his parents way more than me. I shouted that their thinking is not only backward but also racist. I stormed out and went to my friend's house. She is telling me I did the right thing, and since they migrated here, they should follow the American customs. He is not replying to my messages or calls.",1,Female,original
"For context: I (22f) asked my bf(25m) if they would take some time to write out a generalized 5 year plan for their future.

The reasoning being, we’ve been together for almost a full year, met each other’s families, live together and now he has started to lovingly joke about marriage and our future like it’s set in stone and going to happen. And while I’m super happy in this relationship and look forward to that, he is older and wants to settle down and I’m not there yet. In short, I want to make sure we see ourselves going down the same path before we become any more committed to each other or waste any more time together if it won’t work out long term.

I very casually suggested this on an evening when we both had a decent amount of time off and they pretty much threw a fit. They said it was depressing to them, very firmly said “no”, and that they prefer to live day by day. Which is true, but we’ve already come to a disagreement about the future in which something was a dealbreaker between us and we dropped the conversation and didn’t touch it again. I can never get him to talk about the future or his feelings or to plan anything. 

From what I’ve read online, that’s seen as a sign that they don’t see a future with us together, but I know that isn’t true because he’s already told his parents he wants to marry me and that he’s already decided on it. I just don’t want to make that commitment when we disagree on certain morals and values and it becomes an issue in the future. 

He gets super offended or defensive whenever I try to talk about boundaries or finances or the future and says it causes him stress and that’s not how he is. Am I the asshole for trying to make him have these conversations?",0,Female,original
"I (26m) and girlfriend (26f) have just got back from holiday where we argued. I told her I don’t feel enough affection from her and don’t like the way she talks down to me/ treats me sometimes. At the end of the holiday one of her old friends (25f) had a mental breakdown and she was snappy with me because of it. I got really upset and we argued. I ended up calling her friend because I felt bad for her and kind of wanted to help the problem so we could get our relationship back on track. She said she was sorry for being snappy and that she does care about me.

We came back from holiday and everything seemed fine but then she had to go and stay with her friend having the breakdown, which I accepted. The same day as this happened her brother relapsed and started drinking again. This really upset her and the two events combined meant that she had a really bad night. 

The next day I went back to work after my holiday and received an email that I got a second interview for my dream job that I had to work really hard for the first interview. I was extremely excited. I met a friend for a drink after work and had a few. I came to my girlfriends flat excited however she said not to celebrate as I had not got the job yet and that she had a really bad night and day. She ended up coming for a drink with me and my friend too. 

I had about 4 1/2 beers total when she said something that upset me as it was condescending (I can’t remember exactly what it was) to which I replied - “yeah but don’t I earn more money then you?”. I instantly apologised after which she told me to get out of her sight and get my things from her flat. This spiralled into a big argument where I would keep apologising and she would say things like “why are you upset?, your a big man, you earn a lot of money”, which I would say “I’m sorry I didn’t mean it in response.

She kept saying I make everything about me, which I will admit is subconsciously something I do sometimes, not all the time. I wanted her to start being a bit kinder after the holiday and a bit easier going but I get these things that have happened have not helped. I just feel as though I am a punching bag sometimes for the things that don’t go right in her life. 

Thanks for listening. Let me know your honest thoughts.",1,Male,original
"Hi there,  
Throwaway account.  
Minor problem, but my (17) BF (19) seems to be really mad at me. I left the VC in Discord when my BF and his friends were playing some other game that I really didn't like (He knows this) and I wanted to do something on my own while they are having fun. He got real mad. I have no problem if he plays with his friends, but I don't see the point of staying in chat. AITA? I'm really confused.   


Why I might be the asshole - He wanted to spend time with me but I didn't see why I should stay in chat and waste my sunday doing practically nothing. He is doing something with friends and I'm doing nothing, just sitting here. He is expecting me to be all social and talk with him all the time, but ... Yeah.",0,Female,original
"So, for context, this hasnt been a great weekend. My mum has to get a brain scan as there is something wrong with her eyes and/or brain, we are not sure what it is but its not gonna be good either way.

I learned that yesterday and living in another country makes it harder as i cant be there for my family as much as id like. Last night, after hearing about the news, I was feeling shit and went out to distract myself, ended up drinking more than i should (not proud of it but thats how it is).

My gf wanted to meet in town today and I said i wasnt feeling good, mentally of physically, and i dont want to go out or even have her over. I literally just want to be alone and listen to music, as thats how i deal with things.

She took it personally and even though she didnt express her feelings, i can tell that she isnt happy about it. Basically just answered ""ok"" and isnt responding anymore.

My question is, is my need to be alone justified, or should i have made an effort to be with her?

"My bf (19m) and I (20f) are pregnant. It was an accident but we are excited none the less. He has already told most of his family except for his dad’s side with the exception of his cousin who he is really close with. I have told my parents and most of my siblings but plan on telling the rest by getting them tshirts saying aunt/uncle on it. We plan on making an announcement to the rest of our families/friends by the end of the month but aren’t sure if we want to tell his dad’s side (dad, grandma, grandpa, and aunt) yet as they don’t like me because they blame me for my bf wanting independence. Some of the things I’ve been blamed for is him moving out, him not having money to come see them every weekend when they live over an hour and a half away, and they think I have so much control over what he does. When we visit them I do my best to always be respectful and I never do/say anything rude or disrespectful as I want them to like me but no matter how nice I am they always find something rude to say. It’s usually a little side comment about me or they just don’t acknowledge me at all. His dad doesn’t ever refer to me by my name and if he can he tries to not even look at or talk to me. His mom says that we should wait until after Christmas to tell them but I would be over halfway pregnant by then and they wouldn’t be able to come to/know about the gender reveal we have planned in November and I think it would cause more drama overall because they will be the last ones to know. We wanted to tell them before we made our public announcement at the end of the month but they are the type of people to hold things over my bf’s head. Like when he wanted to first move out his grandma threatened to take away the tires on his car that she bought for him as a gift and when he did move out his dad threw all his stuff in the dirt and called him multiple names and degraded him. I can only imagine how they will react once they know I’m pregnant and it’s already a stressful time for me because this pregnancy has been very hard on me so far. When we do tell them, I don’t know whether telling them in person would be best or over the phone so that if things get out of hand we can hang up and tell them to call us when they have settled down.

So are we the assholes for not wanting to tell them?",0,Female,original
"This is my first post here but I’ve always lurked even before having my own account. NGL I am a little afraid to be roasted. Here’s the deal, I am 25(f) married to 40(m) for 6 years (I’ve seen enough of , we have multiple children (all mine) and I have a newborn. My husband will tell you I am a chronic mistake maker, if you asked him he’d probably tell you my lack of attention to detail is overwhelming, he sticks it to me pretty often (every 1-2 days)about how frequently I forget things or make mistakes and according to him he only brings up 10% of my daily errors. For example he would find me not putting the laundry away the same day it’s done and I let it sit on the dresser folded a big problem, or not unloading the dishwasher first thing as my morning routine. If I try to help with certain things he’s delegated to himself he gets upset and will check to make sure I’ve done the daily tasks he wants from me. Mistakes would include things like what I’ll describe below or things like forgetting things he put on the grocery list sometimes (not emergent stuff just snacks etc) I’ll admit I do make some mistakes sometimes because I’m not paying attention, but I’m not dirty, I try to keep on top of my chores and I also work. For years I’ve really felt like his standards are higher than average and I sit around average, this obviously causes stress because he gets very upset with me and it tends to end in tears. In my free time I like to do a variety of crafts and recently I started painting a little. I guess the other day when I was cleaning up for the end of day I must have wiped up a some paint with a Kleenex and then put it in my pocket. The only reason I can think of for doing this is that the baby started fussing and I went over to her quickly, I mean I guess I could have just done it because I had a stupid moment (I’m pretty tired). In any case the Kleenex with the wet paint ended up in the laundry and it put some small splotch like stains on a few pairs of underwear and some pyjamas. I know my husband thinks IATA for it, because I do forget things in my pockets and make other mistakes due to not paying attention. He feels I ruin our things “a lot” which honestly I don’t think is true, the only thing he could even think of in recent time is this vintage coffee maker we have, the dye on the decals started to wipe off, bear in mind it’s over 40 years old and while he says it must be from me cleaning carelessly and spraying it with soap, I think the dye just became unstable after half a century. Things like this. I don’t think I am because it was a real accident and I didn’t mean to., though I accept I need to be more careful and will double check from now on. AITA for forgetting to check my pockets? 

I also wanted to add I am self employed and currently also working so I’m BIG tired 

TLDR 
I make a lot of little mistakes that are a grievance to my husband, I forgot a Kleenex in my pocket with some craft paint on it that was subsequently washed and stained a few things. AITA for forgetting to check my pockets?",0,Female,original
"I am currently 5 months pregnant with a surprise baby who is very much wanted by myself (27f) and my husband (30m). This is quite light-hearted now, I think I am in the right but would like to see Reddit’s opinion!

We really struggled with choosing baby names, I had big lists that I would read off and my husband would just shut them down with barely a thought. He also did not contribute any names of his own. I was also really sick from about 3 weeks of this pregnancy with hyperemesis, ended up in hospital and I’m still on a load of tablets now. So the stress and hurt of all the names I liked being shot down wasn’t helping!

Anyway, we found out our baby is a girl and we decided on a name, he didn’t like this name originally (he didn’t like any!!) but said he had come round to it and liked it now! So that was that, we referred to her as that name and told our parents and everyone was happy.

Then one evening weeks later, after visiting his (JustNo) parents, he announced he suddenly didn’t like the name. I said well it’s obvious your mum has made some sort of shitty comment (standard) and you’ve taken it to heart. He denied that and just said he had changed his mind (again standard protecting his JustNos). I said I don’t think I can go through the stress of having a million names shot down again and honestly I know her as that name now and it would be hard to change it. Maybe it’s different because I can feel her moving around all the time and I’m more connected to her?

He said he would suggest names, the one he did suggest was so similar to the one he didn’t like! Think ‘Lottie’ and ‘Dottie’ in terms of similarity.

So I said no. You were happy with this name for weeks and weeks, it took us ages to find it and I’m not going through it again. This is the name we have chosen and we’re sticking to it.

So Reddit tell me. I’ve given up my life for this pregnancy, I love her so much already but I was bedbound for weeks and still can’t do anywhere near my usual level of study, work and hobbies. I’m not complaining but AITA for putting my foot down on this one thing?",0,Female,original
"I (28F) and my husband (29M) met in college and have been married for 6 years. My husband was raised in a strict evangelical household but broke away from those beliefs around the time we met. We had what I thought was a very happy marriage until my husband's father passed away in early 2021 (he received a cancer diagnosis and was gone a few weeks later). My husband was and is, very understandably, completely devastated - he had remained very close to his father, despite no longer following the religious beliefs of his childhood.

My husband decided to honor his father's memory by rejoining his church. Unfortunately, it is one of those churches that forbids many things I find fun and relatively harmless and classifies them as ""addictions"" or ""tools of Satan."" For example, before his father's passing my husband and I enjoyed having a glass of wine or cocktail now and then (maybe a couple times a week) and also enjoyed weed or edibles (legally) once every month or two. But after joining the church my husband decided he was an alcoholic and drug addict. He also decided that his occasional porn use (we enjoyed it together to spice things up now and then) was also an ""addiction."" He is now insisting that I am also an addict because I don't want to give all these things up. I tried to meet him halfway - I don't care about weed and am fine never using again, and agreed not to drink at home if my husband truly wanted to have a sober household, but said I would still want to have an occasional drink when out with friends. I will admit I like (written) erotica, which he never thought was a problem until he became religious. He also threw away my vibrator saying it was an instrument of the Devil.

The latest is that my husband's pastor told him video games (all games, not just M rated ones) are sinful and now my husband is insisting I have a video game addiction and need treatment. Gaming is a main hobby for me, probably around 8-10 hours a week. It's not an addiction in my view, just something I really enjoy! I work full-time, cook, clean, exercise, etc. I'm not neglecting anything else in my life (except respect for my husband's new beliefs, I guess) by gaming.

My husband wants me to start going to church with him. He says he will go to couples counseling but only through his church, not to a secular counselor. I told him that I understand he is grieving and struggling and I want to be kind and supportive, and if it really helps we can keep alcohol and weed out of the house, but I am not going to become an evangelical (unlike him, I was raised with atheist parents) and am not going to restrict myself to activities he finds acceptable under his religious beliefs. I also asked him to please stop labeling habits he doesn't like as ""addiction."" Of course he now thinks I am an AH for being mean to him while he is grieving. Most of our family members and friends also think I should do what he asks in the name of being supportive. So, AITA?",0,Female,original

"We have renovations going on in our basement and a lot of different trade has been coming through. At times, some of the trade has asked to use our washroom upstairs. I (f35) am not comfortable with that due to COVID precautions and hygiene. We have two young kids as well. A little bit of background, I have a hard time using public washrooms and if we stay at a hotel, it takes be a good two to three days for me to get comfortable enough to go number two. 
I have asked my husband (m37) not to allow anyone to use the washroom due to the above mentioned reasons and due to the fact that it is not up to us to accommodate everyone. Husband feels I am being “inhuman” and continues to allow everyone to use the washroom. 
AITA in this or he is?

Update :Just to clarify a few things .This is a walk out basement with a separate entrance . For all the people asking why I would get renovations if I was worried about Covid. 
Secondly before the basement got demolished, there was a washroom the demolition crew had access to. Obviously that’s gone. 
Then we had the framing crew come in for two weeks and didn’t ask to use the washroom. They did their own thing.
And them completely different experience with the next set of crew. 
I am not looking down on anyone but about my comfort level.

"My (f25) boyfriend (m30) is very luxurious when it comes to bathing. We are talking hour (+) long showers, baths with oils, when he has a bath he always has a shower after, running the tap while shaving. He also soaks through the bath mat every time. I’ve bought my own mat now so that I don’t have to deal with that horrible wet feet feeling. 

I am the total opposite, partly from the way I was raised (quick showers, had a time limit, bath or shower not both). I also know that water doesn’t grow on trees and I am anxious about bills. Im on a student loan right now looking for work and he is looking for work. We don’t have any money coming in. 

We have no hot water at the moment but we do have an electric shower so can attain hot water that way. Im very worried about money, my card got declined yesterday.

My partner has decided he wants to have a bath and fills it up using the electric shower, topping it up with kettle water. This is making me anxious, I think it is a painfully slow, wasteful process and we should just stick to showers for now (no longer than 15 minutes at that).

I’ve brought this up with my partner. He adamantly refused. He said the shower to run the bath runs just as long as his shower would. Im not so sure, plus with the kettle that’s more usage.

He says he doesn’t want to shower like me (quickly) but personally I think you can have a thorough wash in fifteen minutes or less. 

I also find my partner hypocritical, he engages with the eco warrior crowd- I’m not so sure any of this is “eco”. 

I told him if this continues I will put the bill in his name. He said good luck with that I don’t have any money. I said neither do I, in fact you owe me  £500+. He called me an asshole, that I’ve ruined the whole day and said its not fair. 

AITA? Im happy to split bills but I am not as frivolous with water as he is. WIBTA if I put the bill in his name?",0,Female,original
"My 3 kids have been taking guitar, bass, and drum lessons for a while and they're doing fairly well. They've done a couple of short performances (1 song each time) at their music school.

My wife wants them to perform at other venues, which I don't have a problem with. However, she specifically said we (meaning me, the husband) should ask at a local band performance if my kids can play their (the band's) instruments for a few minutes during intermission. I said no, that's not appropriate. Those are expensive instruments which they depend on for their livelihood, and they wouldn't want random kids playing on them. My wife thinks we should just ask, that they can just say no if they want, and it doesn't hurt to ask. I don't even think it's right to ask and put them on the spot like that. Now she's mad at me.

" 

I (27m) live with my girlfriend of six years (24f) in a 1 BR apartment. She's generally very extroverted and I'm a little more shy.  

Recently we've had two fights related to unexpected overnight guests. The first time, my GF announced that one of her friends was going to stay the night on our floor/couch because she was in town, didn't have anywhere to stay, and didn't want to pay for an Airbnb. I like a lot of her friends, but this particular friend is somewhat inconsiderate and annoying IMO. I've discussed not getting along with this friend with my GF before, so I told her that I think she shouldn't have invited her, or really anyone, to stay with us without discussing it with me first. She said she basically couldn't imagine saying “no” to a friend looking for a place to stay, and that I put her in an uncomfortable position if she has to say no to a friend. We argued about it some, but in the end the friend came. She was inconsiderate as usual, but nothing catastrophic. 

Then a couple days ago, my GF, I, and another friend of ours went on a weekend trip and stayed in an AirBnB together. A couple days before the trip, GF asked whether I would mind if two of her other friends met up with us during the trip. I said sure, as long as they don't stay in our AirBnB, which is only supposed to host 3 people and is pretty small. GF said great, they'll get a hotel or sleep in their car. The trip rolls around, the friends come over to our AirBnB for dinner, and then ask if they can stay with us since they haven't booked a hotel. I don't know these friends very well and didn't want them coming away from this trip hating me for depriving them of a place to stay, so I don't respond and wait for GF to say that we'd rather they get their own accommodations since it's very crowded. Instead, she just cheerily says “sure!” and starts planning evening activities for us. I don't say anything, and the friends stay over.  

The next day, I told my GF I thought it was disrespectful that she invited these people to stay the night in our AirBnB after (a) I had already told her I really didn't want them staying over, and (b) we had a big discussion about not unilaterally inviting guests to our shared spaces last month. GF responded that I shouldn't put her in this position vis a vis her friends, and that she just can't empathize with me ever not wanting her friends over, since she'd be fine with my friends staying over if they wanted. I haven't invited my friends to stay over much, because I just value my personal space (and we don't have a guest room or anything), but whenever they've come over for lunch or something, I've checked with her first. All of these friends are relatively rich also, so it's not as though they would be homeless if we didn't host them.

"My girlfriend can be blunt sometimes.  Tonight I was talking about something that happened in a sporting event I was watching.  Part way through, she suddenly said 'I really don't care about this at all.'

Her delivery was quite rude which was what affected me.  I explained how I felt and asked that she just pretend to be interested in something that interests me for the few minutes that I talk about it.

She got mad at me, and said that under no circumstances will she lie.  She also got really mad that I used the word 'pretend'.   (I very rarely talk about these subjects anyway).

I don't ask or expect her to share in these interests, I just want to talk about them sometimes when we talk about how our days went.

I explained to her that when she talks about things that I don't care about, (mainly politics) I always listen to her and ask questions (even though I don't care at all about politics), because she is important to me and I can see that she enjoys the topic.

Thanks for any insight :)

"I(22m) and my wife(21f) got married at the beginning of the year after being together for a year. She’s always been a stay at home wife which I have no problem with I actually like being able to come home and she be there to greet me. But here’s the problem is I’m getting tired of coming home to have to clean the house and do all the chores while she is home all day and just sleeps, watches tv, plays on her Nintendo switch or whatever else. When I’ve asked her to clean if she actually does she cleans for at most 5 minutes and then gets “stressed” out and quits. I work normally 50 hours a week but recently I’m been working 100+ hours a week and it’s been keeping the chores from getting done. I have no problem doing chores I never have and especially if she worked but she doesn’t work and still does nothing to help me. I’ve sat down with her multiple times talk about it and it’s always ended in empty promises of her doing better. Well last weekend I asked her to wash my work clothes because I was busy and tired from work and she came up with excuses all week of why she couldn’t do them. Well this weekend I got really mad and yelled at her for not doing really anything around the house and it ended up being a huge fight with me now sleeping at my parents house. Am I the butthole for getting mad at her for not doing any chores after months of doing them for her

Update: Because It was asked I should clarify that she does have diagnosed anxiety and depression but refuses to take the medicine prescribed to her for that or go see someone to try to help with it.",0,Male,original
"I (23) live in Dallas, and my girlfriend (21) lives in Houston. We're now starting our 2nd year of long distance and we're working through it.

We don't get to see each other often, but we planned for me to visit this weekend so I could go to a Halloween party she was invited to. We bought our costumes and have been looking forward to it a lot. I even asked off work on Friday so I could drive there on Thursday night! That way we could have 3 nights together.

But then...

I got a call from a producer at NBC today. They asked if I was interested in working as a Production Assistant on the Kelley Clarkson Show this weekend. They had got my number from my sister's friend who recommended me.

I've always dreamed of making movies and TV. I've been working in the industry for two years now but jobs are scarce! I'm talking 1 or 2 good jobs per year scarce. I need to take every opportunity I can get if I want a chance of progressing. If I turn down this chance I likely wont get another.

"My (23f) boyfriend (25m) works a difficult job with long hours. He only gets four days off a month. It is really exhausting for him and I hate seeing him so tired. He also goes through a cycle of insisting on waking up at 4:30 to go work out six days a week but then gets so exhausted after a couple weeks that he can’t wake up that early anymore and stops. But he just recently started another cycle of 4:30 wake ups and I asked him if he would consider only working out 3-4 days a week and letting himself rest. Not only is it hard on him but, like most people, he gets more short tempered when he’s exhausted so it’s hard on our relationship too. He says it’s not fair to ask him to stop doing something that’s important to him.

"me (23) and my bf (25) have been together for three years and are currently in two different spots in our lives. I just graduated college and my bf works full time, since he graduated two years ago. Since graduating college, I’ve been looking at graduate programs in other places - such as France and Italy, not for any particular reason but because it would be fun. I had picked out a school that I loved, and was super excited to apply, but, my boyfriend didn’t want me to go, and I was told on all sides to compromise. It’s been a dream of mine to go abroad for an extended period of time, this isn’t news, or shouldn’t be - anyways. But, I compromised and talked it out with my boyfriend, we had agreed that I wouldn’t go over and live there for a year. 
But, since Ive graduated, I have new found freedom and could visit somewhere in Europe for a month and come home. This also upset my boyfriend because it “wasn’t what we agreed on,” even though I’m trying my best to compromise, it feels like at this point he doesn’t want me going anywhere at all, even if he says he supports me. 
Most of my family thinks I’m being an asshole for wanting to go away for that long, my brother doesn’t think I am, but my mom and dad do.

"So, bit of backstory. Me (21F) and my boyfriend (21M) have only been together for 2 and a half months. Before we met he was very much a mother's boy, never had to work and she very must wrapped him up in cotton wool. He had never had a job or even access to his own bank account. Then I came along. We connected instantly and within 4 weeks we were living together with his mum. She was the one who suggested this as he lives roughly an hour from where I was living so I was spending about 3/4 days a week there and commuting to work. She offered for me to move in (rent free, I just had to pay for my own food shopping) and save the money I was paying for rent and put it in savings for when we move out. We all agreed to this and I moved in 6 weeks ago. Since then then have helped my boyfriend find a well paying job, helped him get access to his bank account and taught him how to pay his phone bill. Also, I have paid for new furniture for in his/our room as he only had under bed storage as this was not enough for both of our belongings. 

So since moving in his mother hardly speaks to me. Whenever she is asking one of us about something, she asks him, even if asking about something specific to me (my work schedule, my car, ect), she will just help herself to food in the fridge that I have obviously bought for our meals and has asked me to start paying rent (£50 a week) as since my boyfriend started working he is no longer able to claim universal credit (which she was getting and using as 'rent'). I agreed to this as I am still paying significantly less than I was when renting my own place.

However, although I help with general cleaning around the house and maintain a level of tidiness to our room, it is not up to her standard. I work 60+ hours a week and my boyfriend works 40 so between us we are hardly ever home. His mum however does not work and deep cleans every day. Today she came into our room and kicked off about the state it was in (typical mum ""your room is a pig stye"" type comments) which it was not. She said she is unable to bleach the surfaces in our room because there is stuff on them and when she clears them off we always end up putting it back. I have told her i am not comfortable with her moving my things as everything has a place and she decides to rearrange them as she sees fit, also I paid for the furniture we're using so she does not need to clean it as it does not bother me or my boyfriend. She decided to tell me that if I do not start helping around the house and stop telling her what she can and can't eat in her own home then she will kick me out. I have told her she cannot just threaten to kick me out as I pay her rent and am entitled to ask her to leave my stuff alone. She has now gone out and not been home all day. My boyfriend is mad at me saying I should've just agreed to do it because it's her house. 

AITA for the way I reacted?

EDIT 1: Just wanted to add that she has done this before. His sister and her girlfriend had to move in about a year ago and his mum ended up breaking tjem up. They didn't talk for 4 months after the horrible things his mum said to his sisters girlfriend. Luckily they are together now and living together in the own house with their beautiful baby boy and 2 fur babies.",0,Female,original
"I am a 29 year old autistic female. I've had several great relationships, but they always end because I don't want kids.

I'm the type of person who happily helps others in an emergency. I can fix your computer or car, give rides or food. I can help you solve problems logically.

But I cannot provide emotional support. I'm not saying it's bad for people to want it. I'm just not the person who can give you that. I like to solve problems. When someone just wants to complain about a problem, and tells me not to try to solve it, that it can't be solved, it does something bad to my brain. It gives me anxiety and I've even had meltdowns because of it.

I don't complain and I also don't require emotional support and I never have in my entire life. In fact, my parents took me to be evaluated in the first place because I'd fall and get injured but not cry or react at all.

When someone pours out anxiety to me, I just soak up their anxiety and my brain can't deal, if they don't leave me alone then a panic attack can come on and I've had ones that took days to recover from.

Lately I've somehow ended up on dates with guys that just want to complain to me. Once I'm a captive audience in the pub they just pour out everything wrong with their life, the world, their job, or things they hate, or what gives them anxiety.

If I didn't enjoy a date I thank the person for their time and tell them I didn't feel a connection and wish them good luck. I do this because many guys complain about ghosting and having their time wasted. They usually ask why and I always tell them the honest reason, and they always get angry. But I didn't know what else to do.

Recently a friend set me up with a guy. I don't know why she set me up with him when she KNOWS I don't provide emotional support. There was cable news playing in the pub. The guy was staring at the news like a zombie, and kept anxiously saying he felt like the whole world was coming apart.

I DESPISE cable news since it just works people into agitated states on purpose and manipulates their emotions. They ALL do. I told the guy the news was upsetting him so let's go somewhere else. He said very pompously, ""Well, SOME people could turn their back and ignore these issues, but I'm not one of these people.""

I do not turn my back and ignore issues. I am very informed and spend most of every weekend volunteering in the community. What I don't do is sit and stare at a TV and whine hopelessly in a pub. Instead I take action.

I told him we could leave the pub and do a volunteer activity right then (Saturday afternoon) to make the world better. He said ""Welllll we'll never be able to fix all of it, whatever we do will be pointless.""

The cable news was starting to give me a bad feeling so I ended the date right there and said it would not work out. He asked why so I told him why.

My friend called me up later furious and told me I was an asshole and can't talk to people like that and being autistic is not a good reason.",0,Female,original
"Okay, so, I(22 F) have asked my fiance(26 M) multiple times to stop smoking in the house. Our bed and our pillows have started smelling like cigarettes and he promises that he will stop and he will go outside like two times and then keep smoking in the house. I do not want our clothes and all of our furniture to start smelling like cigarettes so I have asked him to please take it outside on the porch. 

He says I don't accept him for who he is and that I am overreacting. The thing is, he smokes almost a whole pack a day. 

Before we moved in, he would smoke in his family's house because they all did. I have recently given up smoking and have been clean for four months. 

AITA for asking him to stop?

"My Boyfriend, Tony, and I have been together for 8 years. He has had a friend, who is a woman, Jane, for the last 22 years. I  had no problem with their friendship for the first 7 years we were together. But last year I noticed he would leave the room when talking to her on the phone, he deletes the messages they were sending back and forth between them, and I caught him red handed searching for her naked pictures on the internet. I confronted them both and they both said noting was going on. She has told me he isn't her type, and she  date's much younger men. He says he likes to say things to her that I wouldn't like, but just joking.  We argued about this quite a bit, and he stopped talking to her for awhile.

Recently though he was supposed to be on his way home, and I called him to see where he was at, and he said he was going to go visit her. We got into an argument on the phone, and he turned his phone off and didn't come home for 2 hours. He had went to her house, got drunk, and says he played with her son and dog. He messaged her later that night that he ""should have stayed with you and tried to f@ck you"".

I went ballistic when I saw that message. I told him it was her or me, and he needed to cut ties with her completely. I also messaged her and asked if anything had happened between them. She denies anything, said he was completely drunk and he talked about me the whole time he was there, and played with her dog. I believe her, and I don't think she encourages him.

He says I'm an asshole for making him give up a 20 year friendship to stay in our relationship. He says he just jokes with her about things like f'ing her, and wanting to see her naked, and I just don't understand their friendship. So I was wondering...Am I the asshole?",0,Female,original

Last night I wasn’t feeling well and he offered to go get me some frozen yogurt. I said thank you, that would be great. Our toddler wanted to go with him so he ended up going to the supermarket instead and asked if I wanted him to get me an ice cream bar. I said no thanks. He asked again, specifically about an ice cream bar and again I said no. There is a pint of gelato that we both love at our supermarket so I asked if he would be that, and thanked him. He came home a few minutes later with an ice cream bar and was surprised / annoyed when I said I didn’t want it. He said he tried to do something nice and I don’t appreciate it. I said I did appreciate when he offered, but I said no TWICE to wanting an ice cream bar. It’s ridiculous of him to have thought I would be so happy that he came home with exactly the thing I said I didn’t want.

Edit: he bought the same flavor as the gelato that I wanted, so he thought he was right. Except it was still in the form of an ice cream bar that I didn’t want…",0,Female,original
"Hi, I am 25(f) married to 35(m) for 6 years. We live in a major city in an older apartment building. Like most cities and most apartments our building can have issues with various pests. Something I wasn’t familiar with until I moved here. In the time we’ve lived in this unit (5 years) we’ve had two infestations of two different pests, one of which left me with severe anxiety bordering on ptsd (hesitation to say this as I don’t mean to diminish the term but I found it highly traumatizing). I keep the house fastidiously clean out of caution so as to make it unappealing to bugs that eat scraps. My husband opened our dishwasher today and unfortunately saw a roach. He told me and I suddenly felt that hot panic rising up in me, I started immediately checking the kitchen for weak spots and laying down traps and borax under appliances. We recently got a new pet and I was googling how to prevent roaches from being attracted to their food. So my husband begins to try and show me something as I’m reading and I guess I didn’t give it enough response so he started to flip out. He started yelling at me that I was in a “fugue” state and told me to get it together. He called me a child and said that I needed to handle myself better. When I said that yelling at me wouldn’t help my anxiety it made it worse. He monologued along these lines well past the point of my being in tears and then left the room entirely. Now he’s not speaking to me basically. He blames me for the first infestation we got when we first moved in (he says I didn’t rinse the dishes well enough and it caused it, I had never had a dishwasher before and this was probably true but I had no idea, it was really upsetting and since then I’m very careful), he says he “can’t be married to a child” and he “needs to be able to tell me things without me breaking down”. I feel this is unfair as generally speaking I’ve done a tremendous amount of work to manage my anxiety and my (diagnosed) OCD. He didn’t want me getting therapy in our early relationship so I’ve literally done all the CBT work on my own with books and online courses etc. So I don’t want it to seem like I’m non functional. I hold down a full time job and care for 3 children from home, I’m doing my best. I didn’t get mad or say anything back when he was angry except that yelling wouldn’t help and I was sorry. We have a newborn baby and my anxiety about pests is also heightened because I’m terrified of her getting sick. 

TLDR: have had pests and the experience was difficult on me, I am sensitive to the possibility of it happening again and if I see a sign of pests I do extra cleaning etc to try and nip it in the bud. Husband calls my anxiety a “fugue” state and yelled at me for it.

"Edit: I am the AH. I accept it, you pointed it out clearly. I will solve this mess myself. Though I also want to thank some people who gave me useful explanations and who understood my situation. However, you are overall right, it was illegal and stupid. 


My boyfriend ""Alex"" and I are together for over 3 years now. He is 21 now, I am 19.

Two years ago we moved together, but only his name was on the lease. In my country (Not USA), if you own a TV or radio that receives channels, you have to pay broadcasting fees. A (shitty) company is responsible for it and if they know you are watching TV without paying them, they can send the police to force you to pay. It sounds hard, but it actually never comes to that point. Some people even get away with lying and never paying this company.

Anyway, we were living in this apartment alone for the first time without our parents. One evening when I was alone, a man knocked on the door. He was from the company and he wants me to sign something.

This is the point where I was the A-hole. Me, being the very anxious and having low self esteem, signed it stupidly in Alex's name.

He was very angry of course. I didn't blame him for that, it was my fault.

But I blame him for holding it over my head for the last two years every now and then when he has to pay those fees. The thing is, one year ago, he payed an electric store to built out the receiver, therefore the TV becomes a screen and you cannot watch TV channels anymore. However, you have to cancel the fees on your own.

He never did that and often forgot to pay the fees on time, so he had to pay more. It got to the point where he has to pay 3x the amount and if he doesn't pay on time now, it will have serious consequences.

Last month he was angry again over it and said: ""It's your fault, you have to cancel it!"". I did it per mail, but there was no confirmation mail and he did receive a letter to pay for this month, even though it should be canceled. Now I should call this company and need to solve this.

It makes me mad when he gets angry about it and blames me, but in my opinion he is still responsible for the payments and if he missed the deadlines, it is his fault that he has to pay more. He could have canceled it himself over a year ago, but he just kept postponing it.

I learned my lesson the hard way, I am much more considered of my choices and will never ever sign something in another persons name. It could have been worse, but in my opinion it was something he should have been doing anyway.

AITA still for being responsible for his broadcasting fees even though he could have canceled it himself?",1,Female,original
"My gf (25F) and I (24M) have been living together for over 5 years and are in a committed relationship. I recently starting working at a large company that offers amazing benefits including free health care for employees. My gf works at a restaurant and is not offered health insurance as she is considered part time. She currently has health insurance covered by her parents but she will no longer be eligible to stay under her parent’s plan after EOY. 
Today she asked me to put her under my employer’s plan because it’s “free.” My employer offers free health insurance for just employees. Adding dependents to this plan will increase my biweekly payment from $0 to $300. Her first response to me showing her the rate increase was “that’s fine, we’ll each pay half then.” I laughed in shock and told her that was not fair, since I was paying nothing and would now have to pay half of HER insurance. She immediately started to yell at me after I said that. Once our emotions had calmed down, we pretty much just tabled the discussion for another time. 

For some reference here, we both split everything living-wise 50/50ish. I make more than her so I pay for the more expensive utilities and all food/entertainment. But I don’t think it’s fair to pay for her health insurance especially when we aren’t living lavishly. I have tons of debt I’m working to get rid of and losing $300 a month will heavily impact my finances. Am I the asshole here for not adding her to my plan?",0,Male,original

Every time we go out he complains and wants to go home to game. He also has a mountain of credit card debt and has been asking me to cover him..

A majority of the housework is done by me and he often complains whenever he has to do anything or go anywhere .

He wanted to just go home and game, I said I would go home wash the dog clean the vomit and make dinner. Once we got home I asked him for the car keys after bathing the dog and he ignored me so I messaged him and he still ignored even though WhatsApp said he was online… so I ran into his room in  anger and said he is so useless. Apparently he was on discord with two other gamers and felt embarrassed . I told him I wasn’t aware since he wasn’t talking.

He ran downstairs and swore and yelled at me and threw my shoes at me and continued to yell for another twenty minutes .

"My(30M) wife(26F) is a disaster in the kitchen. She leaves a huge mess behind after she's done with cooking. She uses a zillion utensils even to make a coffee(don't ask me how, it's an unsolved mystery). 
Today, she said she learnt this new recipe from her mum and went into the kitchen to prepare it. When She was done it turned out to be vodka pasta. It tasted horrible because she added an entire bottle of vodka. She also put too much salt and it ended up tasting like salt with pasta on the side rather than pasta seasoned with salt. So I told her to make whatever she wants only for herself and never for me and also to clean up the kitchen after she's done cooking. 

To add, I've always cooked for us ever since we got married. I don't even mind cooking for her. She has no reason to cook for both of us. She says she wants to learn to cook. So I told her to make herself food and I'll taste a bit to tell her where she could do better. 

AITA?

Edit : I work as a chef at a restaurant and I work nearly 12 hours a day. So I have just enough time to get as much work done as possible at home and then go to sleep. When my wife cooks, the food turns out to be inedible and it ends up in the trash. Then, I have to clean up, cook again and them clean up once again. So it's so much work for me. She refuses to go to a cooking class too. I don't have time to for and teach her.

Edit 2: She boiled the pasta in vodka and water. Then she made the sauce with more vodka. Her logic was that since vodka is one of the important ingredients, adding more of it would make it taste better than the given recipe. She didn't realize that vodka makes food bitter when added in large quantities.",0,Male,original
My( 17F) boyfriend(17M) was invited to a halloween party. He told me this and asked me if I wanted to come. He said he’d talk in the party’s groupchat asking if he could bring a plus one (me). I said no. I don’t feel comfortable going to parties with all this covid situation and I was planning a completely different thing for this halloween with him. I was planing on him sleeping over so we could watch movies and cuddle but this idea was in stand by because he told me he might go to Switzerland to his fathers anniversary.

"My ex GF and I were together for 8 years. We broke up when we were 23. That was 5 years ago. Part of the reason we broke up was cause I just wasn’t good at life. If that makes sense. After HS I enlisted in the army. Did 3 years, and then just sort of laid around the house until she broke up with me 2 years later at 23. 


She ended up becoming a speacial sort of nurse I guess. Well when she left me I honestly took her words kind of personal. Even though they were 7 years ago. Hearing her call me a failure at life hurt. She did everything she could to help me. And had decided I wasn’t, “worth saving”. It did inspire me to go to rehab and get my life back on track though.


She apparently got fired for something related to not getting a vaccine (won’t get into that since I think it’s against the rules). We’re Facebook friends, and she messaged me. Asking me if I wanted to go out for dinner. I said no originally. But she talked me into it. And I thought wow, things were really turning around for me. It started out with a little bit for groceries, and it’s gotten to where I’m paying her rent despite not living with her. I told her I had to stop since I felt like she was just using me. 


But she brought up the fact that she urged me to go to rehab, and all the other stuff that she did for me (helping me graduate among other things). And she’s right, I do owe her. But I just feel like she only wants me to continue paying her bills for her until she gets back on her feet.",0,Male,original
" 

I have been living with my partner since shortly before the start of the pandemic (February 2020), when we got together we decided to help each other with housework, although she would do most of it because I work from 7am to 5pm ... the problems started when she She realized that I am a casual gamer, normally I played an hour an hour and a half, of course, after doing what I should do and after spending time with her (I clarify the last thing because later it will be important, not that I see it as an obligation"").

Well, this was a huge problem for her, because I was ""wasting the time"" that could be happening with her, we talked about it and then we agreed that I would relax and play days in between, so although it did not seem fair to me, I also had Take into account that she is alone at home all day and due to depression problems that she is treating ...

After a few days with that system, when it was my ""play day"" she began to do the law of ice after my session, visually annoying, when talking to her about this, she told me that she was always alone and that I should pay more attention to her and not to something so stupid, well, I stopped playing for a long time because I did not want problems, I played once a week, on weekends, because even if it bothered her, then I would convince her to do something together to ""compensate"", until I got enough money to improve my PC, with this I wanted to play the games that before I could not due to requirements and I also got a group of friends on Discord, with whom I always canceled because I did not have a mic or a good and clear PC, the problems returned, but much worse, with the same excuse that I do not give enough attention, although we have never stopped spending time together, only that according to her it is not enough, this has been wearing me down all this time, the fact of not p oder to do something that I always did and wanted, or feel bad doing it ... and in the last few weeks I presented him with a game that can now be played on my PC and he spends all day playing, I thought that this would change his perspective of the games, but guess what, it keeps bothering her that I spend 1 hour or 1 hour and a half playing and when I quit, she plays again ... I don't know how to feel anymore, she has been asking me if I still love her, if I still I want to be with her and the truth is that I feel very confused and worn out with everything, I still love her, I still want her to be well, but everything indicates that she does not accept that part of my life and what it has to do with it. am I the asshole?",0,Male,original
"I(40M) and my wife(41F) have been married for a year. I have a son(10M) that lives with us. My ex-wife is not in the picture. MIL and wife are very close. MIL moved closer to wife and I and needed a place to stay. Wife invited her to stay with us while she found a place. I was not on board with the idea as MIL does not like me. 

The problems started when MIL would go into son's room without knocking and tell son to keep his door open. I told her that was a ridiculous request and son can keep his door closed. Another was making vegetarian food and making a scene if we made other food. There are so many more issues, but the biggest issue is how MIL treats my son. 

Wife sees how MIL acts around son and I. She claims that it's just family love. During dinner, I told MIL that I would like her to find a new place and even offered to pay for an apartment. MIL and wife looked at me and started shouting that I had no right to kick MIL out. Wife then says that if MIL has to leave, she will live with her.

"(throw away bc my bf knows my main and is mad at me over this. UPDATE at bottom)

Me (24F) and my boyfriend (22M) have known each other since middle school, we went to different high schools but stayed in touch and started dating about three years ago. We had a break for a while, and recently got back together.

I normally don’t care what my boyfriend does in his spare time, as long as he pays some attention to me. Now my issue comes in when my boyfriend’s best friend (imma call him ‘Kia’(21M)). Kai and my bf are super close, they met in high school and bonded quickly over their love of gaming and art. Also, they stuck together because they were a few of the only lgbt kids in the school (kai is ‘gay’ and my boyfriend is bi).

Anyway Kai and his roommate are having issues, he’s looking for somewhere else to move to, but it has gotten to a point where he ‘doesnt feel safe’ staying there anymore. My boyfriend jumped at the chance to let Kai stay with him while he looked for somewhere else. I wasn’t too thrilled but me and my bf don’t live together so I didn’t feel like I had a say.

Today I came over to hang with my bf and of course, Kai was there. I don’t really know him so I kinda ignored and blanked him. Bf was still in the shower so I went to get myself a drink. I was surprised to find a lot of sweet stuff and candy in the fridge and kitchen bc my bf isn’t the biggest sweet fan.

When my bf got out of the shower I asked him about it and he told me that kai has a really big sweet tooth (wouldn’t have guessed bc he’s in great shape) so my bf brought some of his faves. I felt kinda hurt bc he has never gotten my fave snacks just because. Tbh I also don’t like how close they are, I’ve walked in on them kinda cuddling while playing games and stuff, and just some other comments make me uncomfortable around Kai.

I told my bf this, that I didn’t like being around Kai and honestly, I didn’t like him being around Kai. well Kai heard this, and he ended up going back to his roommate, telling my bf he didn’t want him and me to fight and that he would just try and stick it out for a few more weeks. Now my bf is pissed at me and is begging Kai to come back because he’ really worries about his safety’. That made me feel kinda bad but I was just voicing my concerns and now feel like I’ve been ignored and that he is prioritizing Kai over me. So AITA?

Edit: ok so I talked to my bf. I point-blank asked him if he had feelings for Kai. he went quiet for a few seconds before admitting that he does. he promises that nothing had happened between them, but he has some strong feelings for Kai. he said he's felt super guilty and it had been eating away at him. I told him that it would be best if we didn't continue our relationship, he agreed, he told me he still considers me one of the most important people in his life and hopes we can still be friends at one point. I don't know how to feel, I know I can't blame Kai, and I know my boyfriend didn't cheat but I still feel awful.

I also found out the actual reason Kai didn't want to stay with his roommate anymore and it made me sick. I told my boyfriend to bring Kai back asap. i cant say bc of posting rules but I feel fucking awful about making him feel like he had to go back.",1,Female,original
"I was just talking to my fiance and I mentioned that I feel sad I've never received a personal gift. She got very annoyed at me since she put in a lot of effort into making me a steak dinner. Tried to find all the best ingredients and even asked my dad how to make it. Also she got me a bottle of whisky which she put a lot of research into how to make. (I didn't know any of this till she brought it up) 

I mentioned it during a stupid conversation where I bought myself a calendar from a YouTube I like And said that it's the first time I've gotten something that is about my interests. 

Also there was a mutual friend with us during this dinner and we didn't do anything together before hand or after. I took her out for a whole day doing things that I knew she liked, researched a lot of cafes and took her to a manga museum. Gave her a few presents of things she has mentioned over the year she wants. And threw her a surprise party. 

I know this sounds bad, just hear me out.

What I meant was that I never got a gift from someone that would actually be about something I'm interested in. I don't mean big or valuable just something that's about me.

She loves whisky and she never asked if I liked it before. Where I told her I don't really. 

Well she got upset and said that from now on she's just going to get me valuable gifts even tho I said I really don't care about the gifts and the time spent with her is enough.

I told her that I appriciate her gift and I'm happy that I got it! She day yeah sure, your face said it all. And yes when she made me diner, she woke me up during a nap and I was grumpy.

EDIT: Also to clarify i do not like whisky at all. And this conversation happened 9 months after the event. 

I consider something that follows my interests, hobbies or something that I like as a personal gift.

"Title sounds awful but here’s my story: I (m26) started dating Lissa (F24) about 10 months ago our relationship started very casually and little by little became a bit more serious, but we’re still not in the “I love you” part.

Early in our relationship we developed a very weir dynamic, when she wanted a compliment, she would say something bad about herself and I then would tell her she’s beautiful and that there’s nothing wrong with her for example, she would say her hair looks awful and she whishes she had silkier hair, then I’d tell her about how beautiful her hair and hairstyle is. 

Around mid-September we were hanging out at my house when she found a pic I had with my last ex, I wasn’t keeping that pic for any particular reason it’s just a regular photo of the two of us hugging and I had forgotten it was there (Lissa founded it in an old notebook). She got a bit angry and demanded to know if I still had feelings for her, I told her no and we discarded the photo however Lissa was still angry and started making snide comments about how (in her own words) “I probably still miss having my big boob ex in my life”.

Now I’m afraid of making this sound more misogynistic that it is until now so I’ll be brief: Yes, my ex had bigger breast than Lissa, no, it doesn’t make any difference to me and wouldn’t date anyone based on breast size alone. I do have my preferences but I still not something that definitive. 

Anyway after this incident she would constantly say she “wished she had bigger boobs” so thar she could make me happy, I of course would tell her she is great the way she is and that I love her boobs but after a month of hearing this daily or sometimes twice a day I started getting annoyed and yesterday I told her that if she felt so strong about it she should just get a boob job, then silence, she didn’t argue and just left. 

She hasn’t been answering my text or calls, so at the time I was fed up and felt like it was justified but now with a cool head I think I’m not so sure, so anyway… Am I the asshole?",0,Male,original
"Me 26, my boyfriend 32 have been dating for four and a half years. We normally don’t fight about things like this buuuuut to start off, I really can’t stand his bestfriend. Why? Because he doesn’t respect our relationship. He is always trying to get my boyfriend to do things he shouldn’t as a man in a relationship. My boyfriend never does them, but to even suggest shows he doesn’t respect me and our relationship. My boyfriends bestfriends sister is getting married in a few weeks. My boyfriend did grow up with them, but originally wasn’t even invited to the wedding. Someone said they couldn’t go, so my boyfriend is now invited… without a plus one. So I assumed he isn’t going, and he said why would I not go?! Well for starters I can’t go and we are a package deal as far as I’m concerned. Also I didn’t mention but way before me, my boyfriend and his friends cousin dated (she will be there forsure), I don’t think that is appropriate. He thinks I’m just being insecure, but she also still hits him up from time to time knowing he is with me (he never responds) but still. Also when he called me insecure, it made me angry so he was saying “they are family” and I responded with “has anyone that’s going to be there seen your d*ck, then they aren’t family”. I feel the need to clarify they are not actual family and he hasn’t talk to anyone in 5+ years except his bestfriend. 

Am I the asshole? I just don’t think he should be going. Not to mention we have his daughter every other weekend and the wedding is on one of our weekends with her. Do the math we see her 4 time a month, taking away one day is so much time with her. 

Also I’m bothered because if I was his actual wife, he wouldn’t be expected to go without me. Idk maybe I’m over thinking it.",1,Female,original
"Hello, throwaway account here. Lemme give you all some backstory and info.

I (F24) had a boyfriend (M25, ""Zack"") and a best friend (F20, ""Bella""). She was friends with me for 7 years, and among those years I met Zack and we got together. At first they didn't get along but eventually they became friends as well.

Zack and I were together for 5 years and everything seemed to be fine. One day (around December last year) he called me and said he wanted to break up.

It was traumatic, but ultimately I agreed, can't do much if someone doesn't love you anymore. I tried to be civil and remain friends w/him but only 2 weeks after that, he told me he was asking Bella to date him, and she agreed. To not make things long, they were already on the talks and that was his reason to leave me. I couldn't just take that, so I went no-contact with them.

Life went on, few months back I got to begin a relationship with a wonderful girl and everything seemed to be nice again.

Now, Zack is one to make very personal gifts. I am very masculine in my looks, as in, baggy and male clothing is about 80% of my closet, so he got used to giving me his clothes when they didn't fit him anymore. I would wear them not only as some sign of love, but because I really liked his style. Since I'm a petite woman, I didn't grew that much since those days, so the items he gave me still fit me and I still use them, for now I not only relate them to him, but to me and all the things I lived while wearing those clothes.

Back to the story and why I might be an asshole: last week I uploaded some pictures to my Instagram, wearing a hoodie he gave me and I love very much. I got all the usual comments that I look pretty, doing well and such, and suddenly, Bella shoots me a DM telling me I'm a whore and I should stop trying to get her boyfriend back (I haven't sopked to any of them in over nine months, and whenever I talk about them I either tell the story of the break-up, or straight up say I don't want to hear about them). I asked what was her deal and she told me I should get rid of the clothes he gave me, and any gifts he made btw, and give them back to him so he can choose what to do.

I basically told her to fuck off and took screenshots to send him, since she's prone to take things out of context when telling stories, I didn't want to let her make it as if I was attacking her for no reason. He didn't reply but she kept insulting me and demanding I get rid of my stuff, and eventually reached out to mutuals when I blocked her.

Some of those mutuals say I should indeed get rid of the things, my GF and others say I should do whatever fits my desires, and I personally don't want to lose my stuff just because I happen to not be dating that person anymore. I expressed that and many people seem to believe I'm being childish and doing it just to spite Bella.

So, as much as I don't really think is asshole-ish to want to keep my things... Am I the asshole?",0,Female,original
"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. He's not one to wear perfume or after shave and he barely wears any deodorant (he only puts it on before work). I love wearing perfumes, creams and mists, and overall just smelling good. I have a sensitive nose and I'm very aware of scents (good or bad) around me so I try my best to stay smelling good, mostly for my own sake. I even had my armpits lasered so they wouldn't stink. I don't mind that he doesn't do the same as long as he doesn't smell bad. 

However, lately I've been having a hard time being around him. I'm no longer interested in sex or even cuddling because his armpit odour is so strong it honestly makes me nauseous. For the past couple of months, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to change this. I tried perfuming his clothes, asking him to try on a new fragrance I got, and giving him massages with a nice smelling bar but those were all short time solutions that only masked the smell so I figured I should just tell him. 

One night before going to bed I asked him if he could wear some deodorant. He looked shocked and told me I was rude. He said I didn't' smell so good either and that people couldn't smell their own sweat (which ofc is bullshit because I can smell mine). I insisted I didn't mean to offend him but he was weird about it so I decided to just drop it when he put it on. He kept on going about how rude it was asking someone to put on deodorant and I felt bad about it. 

Thing is, that was just another short term solution. He also uses shirts several times before washing them, which would be fine if he didn't leave them stinking, but whenever he's close to me I just want to run away. I don't want to make him feel bad but I can't take it anymore. It makes me uncomfortable and sometimes I avoid physical contact for this reason but I obviously don't want to break up over something so dumb. I know it's probably my issue because it only seems to bother me but I don't know what else to do. I thought about buying him a perfume and deodorant set or something similar but I don't want to offend him. WIBTA if I asked him (again) to wear deodorant more often?",0,Female,original
"My husband works overseas. He arrived home for fall break 3 days ago. I knew something was off when he arrived. He has a short temper and can sometimes be overly critical. He asked how I was doing and I said I was feeling a little sad and isolated (being home alone without him) and I really opened up to him about how I was feeling, not that I wanted him to fix anything, just that I wanted to feel heard and understood. 

Yesterday we went to a museum. Suddenly my best friend started texting me about taking a potential trip and it was obvious that my husband had texted her. She and I communicate regularly, but I felt a little put off that my husband had texted her about my problems without asking me first, since I didn’t think my problems were that big of a deal, and I didn’t want to make a huge issue out of it. After I chatted with her for a few minutes, I told my husband that I didn’t appreciate him contacting my friend without telling me or asking me first. 

He then proceeded to chastise me loudly in the museum (not yelling bc it’s a museum/quiet place) but loudly and I walked toward the exit because I felt embarrassed. He then proceeded to follow me and cornered me on the balcony outside and continued to reprimand me for bringing it up. I was sort of in shock, but he wasn’t stopping so I told him to stop following me and to leave me alone. He said no and continued to follow me/block my exit until I made it clear I wanted to be left alone and he gave up and left. 

I then realized I had left my wallet in the the car, and he had the keys. I found him and asked him if I could please have the keys to the car so I could get my wallet (I wanted to just sit and have a coffee) and he said no. I begged him with several onlookers feeling humiliated the whole time if I could just please have the keys, that I wasn’t planning on leaving, I just wanted my wallet and he said no and left.

Eventually I just went back to the car and luckily he was just getting back as well. We drove home and eventually got into a huge argument where he blamed the entire episode on me for provoking him, even though my comment about asking him not to contact my friend was literally a one second statement.

"My ex’s family own a big old house that has some adjoining bedrooms and shared bathrooms. There’s my ex’s bedroom and then an adjoining bedroom which has a shared bathroom. You can access the bathroom from both rooms, and there is also a door connecting the two bedrooms. The doors can only be locked from my ex’s room.

So, my son went on a trip with his dad to visit his grandparents and he ended up getting very sick and kept asking for me. I flew to be with him, and I was staying in the same room as my son. The first few days were fine but then my ex decided to be a jerk. 

I told him I was going to have a shower since I didn’t want him to just walk in, and he said it was fine. Yet mid shower, he still walked in and was acting like it was no big deal since I was taking too long and he had an online meeting he needed to get to in 5 minutes, and he had seen it all before anyway. He also didn’t immediately get out when I told him to, he took his sweet time brushing his teeth before he left. 

I didn’t want to say anything in front of our son so it was only after dinner that I could finally speak to him alone. I told him either he sleeps in a different room, or I do. My ex tried to minimise what happened and told me I couldn’t sleep in a different room since our son wouldn’t sleep unless I shared a bed with him, and he wasn’t going to let me kick him out of his own bedroom. He said what happened wouldn’t happen again and that I should shower quicker. I got frustrated and I told him I would just go home with our son if he wasn’t going to move because I wasn’t going to sleep in a room he had access to and we both knew our son wouldn’t stay willingly unless I was here. That was the wrong thing to say because it just escalated things further and led to my ex reminding me that this was his custody time so he got to make the decisions.

"Thanks to careful money management and investing throughout the years, my husband (58M) and I (51F) were both able to leave our corporate jobs recently and move into ""semi-retirement."" In other words we both have part-time work that earns low pay but we enjoy and keeps us busy. At my job, in addition to hourly pay, I go home with about $10-$75 per shift in cash tips, depending on how busy we are. 

Recently I told husband that I had saved up about $5K in tips and that I would like to use the money to replace the carpet in our home. He was surprised to learn that I had been ""withholding"" my tips. He said he felt bewildered that I seemed to feel my tips were separate income that I had sole discretion over. His position is that we have always earned and saved jointly and that my tips are no different than any other income. It should go in the bank, just as my paycheck (and his) goes in the bank. I explained that I enjoy watching the cash add up and since I'm not spending it on myself it's not dishonest. I just like the concept of saving up toward a special ""splurge"" that we didn't already budget for. 

I couldn't help but point out that the other married women that I work with all keep and spend their tip money solely at their discretion and most of them spend it on clothes and vacations. I felt that since the carpet is an expense that benefits us both equally that he should have no objection. While ""the other women get to"" is a very poor and childish argument, I can't help but feel a bit ripped off that I don't get to spend my tips as I like. 

Husband, naturally, says ""I don't care what other people do with their tips. We have no precedent in the marriage for money that isn't shared."" I see his point but I also think it's reasonable to earmark my tips for new carpet, which I want more than he does.

"So, for context, a lot is going on, but the gist of it is my wife and I are getting a divorce, she moved to South Carolina before we agreed to it, and she hasn't gotten a job yes and she's been there for about 8 months, I am the only one paying her rent ($1495), and the $800 I give  her besides that is supposed to be for our kids, but I know for a fact she uses it to pay bills as well as get herself things sometimes!

When she moved, she basically smooth talked on of our mutual friends into taking out a $15,000 loan to help her move across the country, and she was supposed to get a job and help pay it off, well things happened after she moved there and we agreed to a divorce, she is still jobless and isn't paying our mutual friend off because she is jobless and is not really showing any interest in getting a job! I feel bad because when they were talking about the loan, I could have told our mutual not to trust my wife with the money, but instead I basically just said,""You do you, no one likes to listen to my advice"" I decided, instead of the $800 every paycheck, I'm going to give her $700 every paycheck and give the remaining $100 a paycheck to our mutual friend, to help her pay off the loan that my wife talked her into getting, keep in mind, at this point I'm giving her over $3,000 a month at this point, so, am I the asshole?

Edit: It is not an agreed upon/fixed amount, I am only paying as much as I am so my kids don't end up homeless. Basically I'm paying to help out.",0,Male,original
"Once a year (not last) my family goes to a fancy restaurant. Like a place where steaks are 45+ and sides al a carte. It’s a fun treat for us kids at least, as our parents pay. We all catch up, and we get to try places we never can’t afford ( yet) ourselves.  

So 2019 when we went, my parents invited my fiancé’s mom as we were newly engaged and she hasn’t met everyone.  When invited his mom expressed she can’t afford it, and I told her it’s fine cause my parents are paying, its a treat for everyone.  We knew that anyway cause we been helping recently. 

I left absolutely disgusted with his mom. She got 4 whiskey sours, red wine, coke, the most expensive steak,added shrimp and lobster.  Then got 3 sides and dessert.   Her bill alone was just over $500. Meanwhile the single highest bill for the other 7 people was $82.

My parents bit the cost and asked me not to complain, they don’t want to start anything.  BF was equally mad and talked to her.  She tried to say that since they picked the restaurant they can afford it, so it wasn’t a big deal. When it was explained that this a once a year thing before! 

Well this year, my mom invited her again, despite my no, but not so subtlety added a cap to the price point.  Well 20 min or so in the dinner, BF’s sister and son show up unexpectedly which pissed me off, but she asked for her own check, so at least she wasn’t coming for a free meal. 

Her card denied. His mom claimed to not bring her wallet.  Bf immediately asked for her check, but my dad being my dad went ahead and paid it. 

Walking out his sis jokingly asked where we were going next year.  His mom said it’s just it was a joke, calm down.   

So I cancelled the scheduled payment to help her pay 1/4 her rent. It was ~ the same as the meal, so I told her her daughter can pay it or she can. 

Bf is being harassed by them now. AITA?",0,Female,original
"I, 41 y/o female got with my husband David, 41 y/o male for 21 years ago in college. My husband has a twin brother named Daniel who was the referred to as the “wild child” and the “bad twin” growing up. 12 days before his 18th birthday, Daniel left to live with an unknown friend. After graduating high school, Daniel planned to attend Purdue university to study special education and allegedly was dropped off by the unknown friend at a greyhound bus station so he could move Lafayette, IN. and attend Purdue. This was the last known time anyone saw him alive. A few years later, David’s aunt, who sometimes volunteered at Purdue university, discovered Daniel never attended Purdue. This was a huge red flag because Daniel wanted to go to Purdue since he was a young child. Naturally, our family began to worry that something might’ve happened to Daniel after he left the bus stop but brushed it off because the last thing Daniel said to David was “I need time away”. After 10 years, my husband believed that Daniel had passed away because there was noway he would go this long without contacting him. Then in 2017 I recognized a man who I thought was my husband but was stunned when I realized the man was actually my husband’s long lost twin. It turned out, Daniel changed his mind about going to Purdue and attended Washington state university instead. He kept it a secret because he didn’t want anyone to know his intentions. He took a cab from the bus stop to the airport and purchased a oneway plane ticket to Washington state where he created a completely new life thousands of miles away from the life he left behind. Daniel said the moment he stepped foot on the plane was one of the happiest moments of his life, he was so happy free from 18 years of toxicity, mental abuse, and lack of support from his family. Daniel said he couldn’t remember the last time he thought about anybody in his family and wishes the best us but has no interest in reuniting with us. At the end of our conversation, I said this Is going to be an adventure explaining to everyone I met you and asked if he had a message for David or anyone else. He replied “Fuck them, nothing about me and that family works. Don’t even tell them you met me” I figured if David and his family found this out, it would hurt them more then just not knowing what happened to Daniel. Fast forward 3 1/2 years, David finally found Daniel on social media and had been talking to him after 23 years apart. I decided to reveal my secret before David found out from Daniel. David and the rest of our family are furious that I didn’t tell them because it could’ve given them closer as to what happened to their estranged relative. But I just thought I was doing what was best. So Am I the asshole for not telling them?",0,Female,original
"Throwaway Account

I (34m) used to be in a relationship with ""Sarah"" (35f). We met in middle school dated on/off in high school and even talked about marriage in college. This all came to an end when I caught her cheating with my roommate and we broke up. It was really hard but it got worse when I found out that she was pregnant.

Immediately I sought her out and to confront the possibility of her baby being mine and Sarah avoided me while sending her friends and new boyfriend ""Adam"" (guy she cheated with) after me to stop harassing her. I reached out to her mom explicitly stating that I only wished to know if there was a chance that I was the father and after enough persistence Sarah contacted me directly, called me pathetic, that I wasn't the father and if I continued she would call the police. Being a broke 19-year-old, I took her at her word and washed my hands of the situation and transferred to another college and moved on with my life.

Eventually I met my fiancé ""Miranda"" (29f) and we've been very happy together. Before the pandemic we were supposed to get married but understandably that got pushed back. Now that restrictions are loosening up we're moving forward with the plans but have drastically cut down on the number to invites to abide by the venue's safety policy. After completing the list and sending out the invitations I was recently contacted by ""Kevin"" (15m) claiming to be my son. Obviously, I didn't take him at his word and asked who his mom was and he said Sarah. I told him that before he was born his mom assured me that I wasn't the father and asked him why he thought I was. Kevin explained that it came out that Sarah's husband, Adam, wasn't his bio dad, divorced her and hasn't spoken to Kevin in years.

I agreed to take a paternity test and was shocked that I was his dad. I pissed because I asked Sarah if there was any chance and she denied it. Miranda was surprised but also supportive and I've been speaking to Kevin regularly while also making plans to see him. He saw on social media that Miranda and I were planning on getting married in the Spring and wanted to come. Unfortunately, everyone that we've already invited have all RSVP and made special accommodations to attend our child-free wedding. There's no way Kevin can come without Miranda and I disinviting someone else, which we feel is rude. I told Kevin that while I can't invite him to the wedding I promise to put together another event so he can meet more people in my family. He seemed understanding but his maternal grandmother called me up to berate me for not making him a priority now that I'm aware of his existence. AITA?

ETA: Because I keep seeing this

THE VENUE HAS A POLICY ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN ATTEND DUE TO SAFETY. This isn't about fire codes but COVID, not the fact that the wedding is child-free.

&#x200B;

ETA 2: Thank you to those suggesting that we explain the situation to our guests to see if anyone would be kind enough to allow Kevin to come instead. I will talk to Miranda about this but also reach out to Kevin directly since, so far, only his grandmother is giving me a flack for not inviting him.",0,Male,original
"I'm 27, she's 26. We've been dating 2 months. She makes me really happy, she's sweet, friendly, gorgeous, and loving. Last weekend I met her parents for the first time and, it did not go as I thought. I thought, leading up, it'd go really well, I was excited, I figured that because my girl is great, that they'd be great too.

To give some important background, my girlfriend and her family are from the Chicago burbs, her dad's dad made a huge amount of money and I guess you can call them old money rich. I didn't come from much and am just building out my life.

Anyway, so, we go to dinner, and I swear to god, it felt like everything they said was some jab or attack at me. They ordered wine & old fashioned, I got Bud Light. Her mom gives me a dirty look and goes, "" Oh, you're not in the mood for something....better?""

The rest of the night was just her mom & dad bragging about all the stuff they have, cars, private schools, vacations, and then asking if I've ever had XYZ or been to XYZ. 

After getting my 3rd beer( and water) and hearing, "" Are you sure you don't want to see the cocktail list? This place is known for them"" from her mom, I turned to them and told them that they needed to quit the "" Harass the Hick routine"" as I called it, because, I know that that's what they thought of me. 

We wrapped up. We all went to our own places. My girlfriend calls and tells me that I offended her parents and that they're upset with me for accusing them of harassing me. She's trying to play both sides of the fence, but, I get it.

"I (27M) was in a 2 year relationship with my ex girlfriend (26F). We broke up not too long ago, about 3 months ago. 
For context the covid situation in our area had been pretty serious, so we were forced to stay at home together for a significant portion of the past 1.5 years. Whether it was due to the fact that we were cooped up together or our personalities just didn't match, our relationship deteriorated till it hit rock bottom. Once the vaccines started rolling out and we were able to get out more, and get away from each other, we both realised that it was best for us to break up. 
The apartment was leased in my name, so I stayed and my ex moved out to live with her mother for the time being who lives in the same city until she could find a place of her own. 

A week ago, I was out grocery shopping when I ran into her brother. Her brother angrily confronted me for ""abandoning"" his sister and running away from my responsibilties. Clearly flustered I asked for a clarification when he revealed to me that she was 4 MONTHS PREGNANT. 
I immediately left everything and drove up to her mother's place and confronted her. 
Long story short, she found out she was was pregnant shortly after our breakup. Her reason for not telling me this was because "" She was heartbroken by our breakup
and she was so hurt that she did not want me to be a part her and HER baby's life."" This was so confusing to me because we had clearly broken up mutually, and the process had been so smooth, unlike our relationship. 
I angrily retorted that it's not just her baby but OUR baby. This is not the way I imagined having my first kid, but it's gonna be my kid nonetheless, so her feelings about us our irrelevant because I have a right to MY CHILD too. 

Here's the main part: During our conversation she broke out a half empty cigarette pack and lit one up!!!!!! After my initial shock, I asked her to put the cigarette down. She refused. Asked her again, and she refused. Fed up, I snatched the cigarette and ashed it. 
She told me to stop and reached for another cigarette from her box. I snatched the box away and stuck it in my pocket. I told her "" how the hell can you even smoke? Even the stupidest person knows that smoking fucks up the baby and causes complications"" and that's when she said ""you don't have any right to tell me that. Its my body and my kid, I'll do WHATEVER I want !"" 
This devolved into a shouting match before I stormed out. 
Her brother later called me and told me I have no right to tell her what to do because we aren't in a relationship anymore. I got similar messages from some of our mutual friends too. 
I believe it's my duty to protect my baby, even if it is against its own mother, but am I crossing a line by telling her what she can't do? Does the ""her body her rules"" concept apply here, even though she is endangering our child? 
AITA for not letting her smoke?

Edit 1: Thank you for all the responses. 2 points of information that are relevant
1) Ex used to smoke twice a day max during our relationship, 1 in the morning and 1 at night. Never more never less at least in my knowledge, so does the concept of nicotine shock still apply here? 
2) Based on the timeline she was pregnant before the breakup. Due to lockdown we would basically be with each other every day. So unless she did something with someone for the few hours I was away grocery shopping......then I don't really think she cheated.",1,Male,original
"So for some context I'm 26 year old gay guy and I just had an arguement with my boyfriend over the phone  about another arguement he had with his friend earlier in the day, which resulted in him hanging up on me. The short of it is a long time friend of his, who I'll call N. has a little sister who is around 13 who has recently started vaping, and N occasionally let's her sister vape with her. This pissed my boyfriend off and he basically yelled at her saying that she was enabling her. That she should tell her that vaping is bad and maybe even tell her parents, and that he might if she doesn't 

To which N responded that if her sister wants to vape, she will find ways to and she would rather that it be with her than with other kids that she doesn't know.

I tried to take the middle ground as he was describing this to me and said that i thought that both of them were right, it's not a good thing that a 13 year old girl is vaping, but at the same time, having been 13 once myself, I know that  just saying ""drugs are bad"" when both he and N vape almost every day themselves will be completely counter productive. It'll just send the message that 

1) You are a hypocrite 

2) You can't be trusted

"Alright. I gotta give a little backstory here to be fair. Me and my girlfriend have been together a little over 3 years. Our relationship had a rocky start (I was on drugs, cheating, etc) I ended up going to jail, but when I got out, I straightened up, hardcore. Got clean, held a job, stayed faithful, etc. And I've stuck with it. I've completely changed from what I used to be. 
3 years later, and she still doesn't trust me. She wants my location on when I go places, videos, the works. I've obliged, as she has BPD and I understand it's a pretty sensitive topic. 
My dad has a trip planned, to fly me out to Oklahoma for a few days (I live in Florida), to see my grandma and other family. My grandpa passed away a few months ago, and I know this might be the last time I'm able to see my grandma. 
My girlfriend refuses to let me go. She's upset that she wasn't invited (she's made no effort whatsoever to be involved with my family throughout our relationship) and she says if she can't go, and I go by myself, then we're breaking up. She wants ME to pay for her ticket, if she's even able to go, etc.  End of story. I've pushed away friends, I've declined family functions, to make her comfortable and happy and everything throughout the relationship. But it's gotten me nowhere. And the ONLY reason she even wants to go, is because she doesn't trust me. 
I'm really siding with saying screw it, and going to see my Grandma. Am I the asshole for not involving her, or just willing to say screw it anyway? I understand we had trouble in the past, years ago, but I've truly changed. She just refuses to believe it. Even after everything I've proven. I'm just morally torn here.",0,Male,original
"At lunch I sit with this only sit with this one girl and she often has to do marching band stuff during lunch.

I also understand that since I only ask him to eat with me when shes busy I seem like I’m using him. However, it’s only us two at lunch so I don’t want to leave her to eat alone by herself when it’s not absolutely necessary since she wouldn’t have anyone to sit with and would be all alone.

"My (F26) boyfriend (M28) are on the same page about getting married and having kids later next year. But recently he always jokes around about me only wanting to marry him to take half of his assets when we get divorce, etc etc. Two of his close friends went through all that and I understand where his concerns were coming from.

I always explain to him calmly that I don’t get married to get divorce, or sometimes I just laugh at him. I love him to bits and I let him know that I don’t want this issue to become a bigger problem someday. Even I suggest prenups, but he doesn’t believe in prenups. He said I still could get more money especially if we have children together.

And now it happens more often and sometimes he said it with a serious face, afraid that he will be left with nothing if we don’t work out.

Today he did it again and that was the last straw. I immediately snapped at him by saying, “well if that’s the case, it should be me who should be worried since I make three times more than you.”

"My husband's extended family has a big outdoor party in the fall (100+ people). They had one last year (pre-vaccine, no masks), we didn't attend. There's another next weekend.

We live 2 plane rides away. When we were invited, we jointly decided not to go. He was disappointed, but we agreed it wasn't a good idea because 3 unvaccinated kids plus travel plus large maskless gathering.

I started back to WFH part-time and it's a lot. Baby doesn't sleep well, and it's only me getting up at night. I said something yesterday about being exhausted and considering cutting back work hours.

This morning, my husband said, ""I have an idea, but I don't think you'll like it."" He said he wanted to take all 3 kids to the party, and that I'd ""get to stay home."" I said no. He asked why, and I said reasons we already decided, plus I'm not interested in being away from the kids for that long. He again asked why. I said it's not safe, and the baby (8 weeks) is too young to be away from me. He called me ""irrational"" and said, ""You want to sleep, I'm trying to get you sleep."" I told him he didn't think I would like the idea so why push it, and he backed off.

I was really bothered about it, so tonight I asked to talk. I said I felt blindsided. It seemed like he changed his mind about the party, but instead of asking to change plans, he came up with a scenario where they would go while framing it as a favor to me. Pressing after I said no and calling me irrational was unfair. I said if he wanted to go, we can discuss making it happen. 

He said he didn't blindside me, he just wanted to revisit the discussion. He wanted to get me sleep, and them being near family would allow that. He said that I was assuming the worst of him by accusing him of having ulterior motives. He said ""most"" of my reasons were legitimate, and apologized for calling me irrational. But then he said that not wanting to be away from the baby wasn't reasonable, and he would jump at the chance for a break. 

I told him if he wanted to give me sleep, take the kids out for an afternoon.  Not wanting to spend multiple days away from my newborn is normal due to hormones and the baby's needs, and that postpartum depression has been triggered by far less. Then he did a 180 and called me irrational again, and told me ""saying that you have a lot of hormones makes you irrational"". I used some choice words and now we're not speaking.

I don't think ITA for not wanting them to go, but he might have a point about me interpreting this as him just wanting to go to the party and disguising it as a favor. So AITA?

"I (f28) went over to a male friend’s house last night. There were 7 people there in total, including me and the male home owner. There was alcohol, and I brought a few drinks for myself to enjoy. I came home just after midnight.

When I got home, my husband (M, 42) asked me why I was out so late. He said that it’s “odd” for a married woman to stay out at a man’s house until after midnight.I reminded him that it was a group thing and that he can verify that with his own coworkers who were there. He said no that they could just cover up for me since they’re my friends. He also asked me if it was a swingers party (I’m not sure where this came from).

I’ve never cheated on him, and we’ve been married for years. Also, I’m confused because I told him about my plan to go to this friends house several days ago and he never said that he was uncomfortable with it. He said it was okay. If he had said something, maybe I could’ve invited him to come too or told him to drive by the house and see how many cars were there or something.  I also told him to ask any of the people there last night if he doesn’t believe me. 

It’s more confusing because I’ve spent nights out before at this male friend’s house with many of the same friends (it’s a friend group I’m part of) and not had this problem. But those other times I came home at 11:30 or 11.

He seems to be fixated on the fact that it was like a few minutes past midnight that I got back. He thinks that married women don’t do that and that I should know that.

He’s now saying that I can “sleep with whoever I want” and that we can have an open marriage and be honest with each other when we sleep with other people. I don’t think he wants an open marriage he’s just saying that’s what I want when I’ve never asked for that.

"My (33m) wife (30f) and I are currently at an impasse.

Canadian Thanksgiving is coming up this weekend. My wife is working and can't make it, but I was planning on going. However, plans were recently postponed. It was decided that the gathering would be delayed by a week, when it would also be the birthday weekend of her sister. A double-celebration, if you will. Plus, my wife would be able to make it now. A nice family gathering.

However, the delay caused the day of this gathering to occurr on a day that I've been looking forward to for a long time: The DotA 2 International Grand Finals.

For the many who won't know, this is arguably the biggest E-sports tournament in existence, for a video game called DotA (my favourite game). The tournament typically happens annually, however last year's tournament was canceled due to COVID. This means it's been two years since this tournament has taken place, and is something I've been massively looking forward to. So much so that I had booked an AirBNB in Romania, where it's hosted, with the full intention of travelling there to view it in person—until the COVID situation in that part of the world became a shitshow, making it unsafe to travel there.

Changing gears, I invited a few of my close friends to come over for a few days during that time, so we can all watch the final rounds together. This means a whole lot of DotA for the days leading up to the tournament, along with the tournament Grand Final day itself. For the record, I put these days on my Wife and I's shared calendar a few weeks ago.

Needless to say, I am extremely excited about it all, and when I heard about the change of Thanksgiving plans, I swiftly informed my wife that I will not be able to attend the rescheduled event. She was disturbed by this, and is having a really difficult time understanding how a video game tournament could ever take priority over a family gathering. Especially considering we're both very close with SIL.

The thing is, I'm dead-set on watching these finals. If, say, there was a wedding, or a birth, or an emergency, or this wasn't the ultimate day of the ultimate tournament, I would make exceptions. But given this exact context, there's pretty much nothing she could say to convince me not to watch. Hell, even if my verdict here was a unanimous YTA, I still can't see myself missing this.

After her initial incredulity around my immovable stance, she begrudingly relented. But she requested that I make an AITA to get the multi-faceted perspective of Reddit's judgment. (She has read—and approved—of this post and it's details prior to me making it).

So Reddit, AITA for skipping thanksgiving and SIL's birthday, while living my best life nerding out with my friends watching the DotA 2 International Grand Finals???",0,Male,original

"EDIT: clarification: There's already an ethics complaint percolating against her former therapist. The suit is for damages for both of us with the lions share going to her. Her participation in the case is over, she wants the case dropped because it's taking too long and she just wants it to go away

I 33M was with my ex 29F for a four years before we did an oops and found out twins were on the way. Turns out it's less birth control and more birth avoidance. Much further along than usual we had a miscarriage and she spent a few days in the hospital and was understandably devastated. I wasn't in the best shape myself but her doctor strongly recommended she see a therapist to help her work these issues out. 

While she was in therapy we got even worse news after genetic evaluation revealed we likely wouldn't ever be able to bring a child to term. I'm short on details because the doctor who explained it to us made my eyes glaze over, but the jist was us combining genes wasn't a thing that should happen.

Things weren't the same after that, and we started to drift apart. Well, I say we but I mean she for reasons that will shortly become obvious. She kept saying it was a sign and it wasn't meant to be and kept shooting down alternatives I looked into, like an alternate donor or adoption. Eventually she decided she'd had enough and moved home to her parents. I won't lie and say it didn't tear me up even worse and I didn't plead for her to reconsider, but I never ever blamed her. I recall feeling bewildered about what had happened but never thought she acted out of malice.

A month after she's home she calls me in tears and says she made a huge mistake and trusted someone she shouldn't have. Turns out her shrink was manipulating her into leaving me. I know this is what he was after because she didn't clue in until he ASKED HER OUT ON A DATE three weeks after she'd moved out. Once she stopped thinking of him as a doctor and took a step back she saw what he was doing and felt awful.

She's still my ex despite both of us doing our best to make things work it just wasn't happening. She gave me the information to start the lawsuit and it's been progressing slowly but surely. Recently though she's asked me to drop the suit because she just wants to close the door on this chapter of her life and move on. I'm on the fence about this. It's not just her life that's been ripped apart here, and what's to stop this guy from just doing it again? I don't wish my ex any more pain than she's already endured, but I also don't know that I could live with myself not doing everything in my power to stop this monster.

I'm currently 2 days late for my period (I think this is kind of early to check but I just wanted to check as early as possible) and when I went to get the test as well as some contraceptives, I asked him to come with me, he said no to which I asked why and he said that he wasn't ""comfortable with getting them because its awkward"" I said whatever and went to get them on my own.I took the test like an hour ago and told him, he told me to text him the results and not to call him because he doesn't like calling and he's in pain because he tore a muscle in his leg. when I told my friend about it she offered to stay on call instead of him and I said yes, the test came back negative thankfully but I was genuinely considering not telling him until text time I see him (in two days) because he didn't want to be there as soon as the results came in but I felt that he had the right to know so when he called like 10 minutes later to ask I told him it was negative and he told me I was being a drama queen for jumping to conclusions just because I was a day late for my period (it was 2 days but whatever). he said he didn't need the stress and already knew I wasn't pregnant and ""just needed some plastic test to tell me"" i hung up on him some time after that because I was so upset with him but now I feel bad

"Hi everyone! So essentially my situation is that Last night my girlfriend and I had plans to stay in and watch movies and just chill as I would have just had a long day at work doing one of my most difficult shifts while she was writing her dissertation with some university friends. Jokingly she invited them to the pub, not actually expecting them to show up. When I get home she says she invited some of her friends to the pub and invites me to come along. Although apprehensive, I begrudgingly obliged and joined her and her class mates. After about 1 hour my social battery entirely ran out and I just wanted to go home, though I didn't say this out loud, I definitely looked beat. My girlfriend suggests I can leave anytime to go back to my place and not with her, so I say I'll stick it through in hopes we come home and are able to watch our movie.

We end up staying at the pub until close while the whole time I admit, I wasn't trying at all to engage in any conversation as the one person I knew, my girlfriend, had her back to me the entire time. When we leave she tells me she doesn't want to stay together tonight and to go back to my place, in which I try to reason but to no avail. So we both go home and after trying to get a response from her via text for about an hour she texts saying she doesn't want to talk now and wants to talk in the morning, so I give up and sleep.

Once the morning roles around she doesn't text me until I message her 3-4 times asking if she's okay. She responds calling me selfish and that I didn't make an effort and was embarrassed of me for my behaviour and says she wants some time alone.

I do understand where she's coming from but I don't think she's appreciating that I had just worked a 13hr shift and was tired before we even left for the pub. Along with that we had plans to rest that evening. Though I think she may have taken a nuclear option with not wanting to talk to me for a while.

TL;DR:

Went to pub with Girlfriend once she spontaneously made plans after a long tiring day of work and didn't act as socially as she wanted me to.

INFO:

I should clarify, she was really advocating for me to come and said she'd make sure she'd introduce me to her friends, as we've just left a friend group which were heavily involved in drugs etc. Not nice people, so we've been trying to get new friends.",0,Male,original
"My husband (29M) and I (28F) have been married for a year and are expecting our first child in March 2022. This is my first ever pregnancy and both of our first children. We were both invited to my husband’s cousin’s wedding in Colombia at the end of January 2022 during which I will be 34 weeks pregnant. I immediately said that I wasn’t going to go as it’s too far into the pregnancy and there are other associated dangers and risks with travelling in general, as well as travelling to Colombia. I told my husband many times that I did not want him to go either as I’m nervous about delivering early or having any complications and I asked him to support me in that decision and think of another way we could support his cousin besides being at the wedding. My husband decided to book the trip for himself anyway for 5 days during the wedding and said that “this is what [he] decided and what [he is] doing and that’s that.” He believes that I am being irrational and paranoid and equates him leaving the country (we live in Canada) to go to Colombia as the same as him working out of town (he works 6 hours away on a 2 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule). He and this cousin are very close “like brothers” and my husband is supposed to be in the wedding party but was replaced quickly when we initially were not going. He feels that he should go because he’s in the wedding party but I feel like he is choosing his cousin and the wedding over me and our baby. Am I the asshole for being upset with him for going to the wedding?

Edited to add: sorry I should clarify that the wedding is in Colombia, South America. Also my husband and I are not Colombian, and neither is his cousin. His cousin is marrying a Colombian girl who neither of us have ever met. The area where is wedding is happening is 3 hours by car to the nearest airport and the flight is an average of 21 hours long.",0,Female,original
"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years and have been living together for three. We love each other very much, but a recurring subject is that he feels I don't trust him or ""respect him"" to get certain things done. Truth is, he's right. I don't!

I feel awful for admitting that, but he hasn't shown me that he's capable of it. For example, he cracked my car side mirror and has been saying ever since that he'll fix it himself, but it's been over two years and nothing. A few weeks ago he accidentally pulled down one side of the blinds in our bedroom, but propped it back up in the drywall hoping I wouldn't notice. When I did, I pointed out that if we leave it like that, it's going to keep dragging at the drywall and make the holes bigger and harder to fix. He said he'll fix it, then got mad at me when I said ""Are you sure you'll do it? I'll fix it myself right now if not."" He insisted he would do it and said that I should trust him, but fast forward weeks later, and nothing's been done. On a more serious note, he got an extension to do his taxes this year because he waited so long the first time around, and I was the one who had to remind him of the final deadline just days before it came about. These are just a very small few examples of the many situations in which he says he'll do stuff and then never does. It's also upsetting because he's had off from work from the past two months and has literally spent every day just camped in front of the TV playing video games. He acts like doing super basic things like laundry or cleaning is a triumph that I should be eternally grateful for, and how dare I expect anything more (for the record, I also do laundry and clean. I think these are simple things everyone should do.) I feel like a nag, and I don't want to nag! But alas, I feel like I have no other choice.",0,Female,original
"I cannot believe I have to result to bringing my grievances to reddit, but as a long time redditor and someone who keeps getting insults hurled at them I really need to know if I'm the crazy one.

My (30M) wife (30F) is pregnant with our first child. We recently found out that we're having a little baby boy. A few weeks ago we decided to write down all the boy names we like, make a priority list, and then let the names simmer for a couple of weeks before we make any judgement calls. Now, I know the names my wife likes. If i'm being completely honest, they are usually very Southern and attempting to be ""modern"" (think the name Kaysen or Braxton, both names were on the list). However, at the top of her list and one with a high priority was the name Scott. Now, no hate to the name Scott, just very out of left-field for her. She told me how much she loved it and how it meant a lot to her and when I questioned her on it she didn't really say much more. I actually loved the name Scott so we kept it #1 and it was also at the top of my ""simmer list"" as we had been calling it.

Well yesterday we ended the our simmer period and both decided on the name Scott Kainen. Both names were #1 on our lists and we were over the moon. As we were going to bed I asked how she thought of the name Scott and she admitted to me that now that I ""set it in stone"" that she felt more comfortable telling me. There was an older man she apparently worked with, who I had never heard of before, that she really loved named Scott. She said he was 66 and gave her a lot of life advice and guidance but died last year due to being immunocompromised.

After she said this to me I became completely uncomfortable. I don't want our baby named after a dead coworker of hers I've never met. I asked if she asked his family if it was ok and she said she's never met his family and doesn't think it's necessary. The whole thing is just so bizarre to me considering I've never heard of this guy before. She mentioned the passing of a coworker last year and I knew she was sad but she never said much more than that.

Long story short- i told her were not naming our baby Scott because I don't feel comfortable with it. She immediately got mad at me and it turned into a big argument. I had her mom and sister's call me today saying I liked the name before but that I was being a jerk over some old dude and my wife won't even talk to me now.

I like, even love, the name Scott. I don't like naming our baby my wife's dead coworker I don't know. AITA?

Edit: Just for clarification, I would not mind keeping the name Scott (and I have communicated this to my wife) if she would tell me about him so I know who were naming our child after. She won't tell me anything past that he was a mentor to her- no other details. As well, I was mainly upset because I felt like I was tricked into the name because she withheld obvious intent with it's meaning. I would have probably been a lot less confused or weirded out if she would have just explained that before. But since she will not talk to me about Scott and is essentially stonewalling me until I give in, I feel as if I may not be the AH here. I will take my judgements as they come, but there's more of my side of the story.

Edit 2: sorry for the edits I just want to clarify the the permission from the family thing. She wants to actively make posts linking to his facebook about our child's growth and development. I feel like it was a little... weird to do without asking his family if they're comfortable with that especially since they've never met. That's why I thought she knew his family because she was telling me the hashtag she created for it and everything.",0,Male,original

"AITA for canceling a air bnb (its in my name and I paid for it 100%) the week of a wedding that my GF is in the bridal party for, because the bride and groom failed to provide a block of rooms at a hotel close to the venue and they decided to stay at a wayyyy over priced hotel 30 min from the venue. This is downtown in a major US city, with the assumption that I was going to let whoever from the wedding come party in this air bnb,  without me knowing ahead of time. I would also have to drive from the venue to the air bnb following the wedding while the bride and groom paid for their own transportation down town. The bride made my GF get this air bnb so we could be close to them that night.... but after asking around us and one other couple are the only ones staying down there.

I was on the phone with her for 5 minutes and my cat wanted attention and food, so I switched attention to her. She then started saying how I was calling my cat pretty more than I had called her pretty, but at that point, once again, my cat wanted attention and I had barely been on the phone with her long enough to give her my full attention.

"another post got me thinking about my own situation involving a dress, and i've been called the asshole and my wife is pissed at me - so just wanted to check in to see if I really am or is my thinking justified.

This happened a couple of weeks ago at a wedding I (37m) had attended. during the reception, while everyone was dancing and generally having a pretty good time I was sitting off to the side while my wife mingled with her friends (it was my wife's friend's wedding so I didn't really know anyone there).

at one point she called out to me to come over - so I stood up from the chair I was chilling on and started walking over. I accidentally dumped into an older woman and spilled my drink (wine) all over her dress - I immediately felt bad, the woman started tearing up saying her night was ruined and offered to pay for the damages. she ended up leaving early since she was wearing like a... pastel pink(?) and the red win did not compliment it, to say the least.

A couple of days later, the woman contacted me and asked if I was still willing to pay for the damages. and I said of course, it was my bad - and she then sent me a link to another dress that looked nothing like the one I ruined, and it costs $6k+ (???) and she said there was no way to fix the damages to the original dress so if I can buy this dress as a replacement.

sure, I could afford the dress, and I do feel bad that I ruined the original dress, but felt that the price of the new dress was suspicious, so I messaged back saying ""I'll need proof that the original dress costed similar to the amount this new dress costs. so send over the details and I'll get it sorted"" but somewhat expected, the woman started making excuses saying she lost the original receipt, or that the designers website isn't listing the dress, blah blah blah. I told her to send the proof within 24hours from the time of this last message. so she called me a child for not taking responsibility and that I should pay for the new dress since I have the means to pay (i do, but big question is how does she know this) - I told her no dice, ""it's simple, give me proof the original costed anywhere close to the price of the new dress and it'll be done - 24hours or offer is off the table.""

anyways, I'm sure you can guess what happened - but no proof was sent so I dropped the matter and told her as such. turns out this woman was the bride's sister (wifes friend), and now she's angry that I refused to pay for the new dress and now my wife is angry since her friends are now angry at her. although she agrees that the price of the new dress seems ridiculous and said that no way did the original dress costed that much since in the words of my wife ""like how, she's a welfare sponge"" (someone who games the welfare system) but wife still think I should pay for the new dress so that she doesn't lose her friend.

we have separate bank accounts, and she could easily pay herself, but she thinks it should be on me.

We try to split chores evenly although I most often end up doing a little more since I work from home. I do the laundry, cooking, and take care of our 8 month old daughter during the day as I'm at home and feed her during the night as I'm awake during the night anyway.

"My cat is 7. To put it nicely, she has always had behavioral issues around her litter box. It’s been that way since I got her at 6 months.

My husband hates her. He is allergic but I work to make sure the house is kept clean and his allergies are not as bothered anymore (he’s lived with her for 5 years). Mostly it’s just a mutual dislike of each other. He has wanted to get rid of her since we got married and I have always refused. He was the one who originally got her for me, and I will die on the hill that animals are not to be sent to a shelter because they’re inconvenient. I agreed a couple years ago that if someone else wanted her, she could go but I absolutely will not take her to a shelter because I know what will happen- no one wants an older cat with litter box issues. She’ll stay there and be miserable until they euthanize her. I am not okay with that.

My husband says I am an AH because I know how much he hates her, hates her issues, and he’s allergic. Am I the AH for keeping her?

Edit for clarification: we have done everything short of behavior therapy for this cat. She poops outside the box if I’m late feeding her or if I go out of town for the weekend. Now I think she’s done it for so long she just doesn’t like using her box anymore for pooping. She has two boxes (we’ve done covered, uncovered, different locations, litter, the whole shebang). My husband isn’t abusing her. He used to yell at her when she’d do this but he isn’t allowed to touch or talk to her anymore. He just ignores her now.

The things that we haven’t tried I’m making note of to see if we can find something that will work. The last two years I’ve stopped trying to change the behavior and just dealt with it so I think it’s time to start trying again.

Also, yes I am positive he is not abusing her. He is a good, honest guy, he was just raised with the idea that pets come and go and are disposable. The idea of even visiting the vet is out of the question for someone who never got to go to the doctor himself. It’s hard for someone to change that kind of mindset.",0,Female,original
"My husband (27M) and I (26F) just got back from a weekend trip where me and our daughter (2) were in a wedding. My husband has no ties to the people at the wedding. 

We both agreed that driving would be the cheapest and best option with our two year old even though it was an 11 hour drive. I reminded him many times before the trip that as I was the maid of honor I wouldn’t be much help with our daughter at all during the trip. He also would rather I not drive. I’m not the best driver, but it might have helped some.

The night of the wedding (day 3 of the trip) he insists on driving back home. It was 8:30pm when we left and I kept asking if he wanted to get a hotel. Keep in mind this was not the plan, we were going to stay the night in the air b n b with other wedding party guests but he found that situation awful. 

He managed to make it through the night and the next day I tried to stay awake with our daughter while he slept through the day.  I arranged for my little sister (10) to come over and help after a couple hours as I was so tired I felt like a bad mom for not being able to be more active. 

The next day I spent the morning at the park with our daughter walking to and from (about 2 miles total) and it was nice to get out and let her run around. I realized that I had kept the keys to our car on accident and came home around 2:00pm so that we could go grocery shopping. There wasn’t a lot of food in the house because of the trip.

Our daughter had fallen asleep on the walk home and we put her in bed. He suggested that I go get him food and I laughed and said “no way just door dash it”. He immediately flips out and goes on about the whole weekend and how I can’t even be bothered to get him food and how ungrateful I am that he drove so much and how much he did for me this weekend. 

AITH? He slept until 1:30pm and could have door dashed something.

EDIT: to clear the air, he’s a stay at home dad and does spend a ton of time with our daughter.

The two of them have been working together to plan a family road trip, the highlight of which is to build bears at a big mall nearby. I don’t love the idea, because the house is too cluttered already, but it’s their birthday.

"I feel like I probably need to give some background for my reaction to make sense…

When I found out I was pregnant my ex and his family weren’t thrilled. They thought I had done it on purpose and that I was trying to both trap and ruin my ex’s life. My ex’s parents tried very hard to get me to have an abortion, they even went so far as to trying to bribe me to do it. When that didn’t work, they made a lot of threats about taking my son away from me and how he would grow up never knowing who I was. In the end, I took the money and lied about having the abortion just so they would leave me alone. When my son was a year old my ex found out and his parents tried to make good on their threat. What followed was the most emotionally and financially draining experience of my life. My ex eventually seemed to realise it wasn't in our son's interest to do what his parents' planned and stopped trying to take our away from me just when it looked like they were going to get what they wanted. Now I reluctantly co-parent with him and even though I try to be nice to him for our son’s sake I’ve refused to have anything to do with his family. I accept my son will spend time with that side of his family, but I want no part of it.

So, I was shocked when they showed up on my doorstep and told me they had come to pick my son up because my ex was held up by a client meeting. I told them that he wouldn’t be going with them, and they can tell my ex to come and pick him up when he was done. They asked me if they could come inside and see him since they hadn’t seen him in so long and they were already here. I didn’t even respond; I just slammed the door shut in their face. They kept knocking and I ignored it. I took my son in the garden as the doorbell isn’t so loud outside and distracted him until they stopped. 

My ex called me over 10 times while they were still knocking but I ignored it, he also sent me a text saying it was his time and he had given permission for them to collect him. My ex ended up coming to my house long after our son had gone to bed, and he was furious. We had a huge argument where he said his parents were our son’s family too and I had to let the past go. I told him I would never let it go and that I didn’t want his parents coming to my home ever again. My ex tried to say if I had forgiven him, I could forgive them too. I’ve tried to keep my feelings on the matter to myself because it won’t help us co-parent, but I was so angry in the moment that I told him I hadn’t forgiven him, and I wish he would leave and never come back. Now he’s acting weird around me and even our son mentioned his dad seemed sad.

"I am posting this for my mother (f53) who does not have or use Reddit but enjoys having me read AITA situations. She now finds herself in one. 

My mom works as a teacher for a small non profit school making about $38k a year. She owns her own car outright and rents her home. She has a fair amount of debt(medical bills, collections, credit cards, back taxes ECT). In addition to her bills she was only paid part time in the summer and although she worked another pt job she did fall behind and has been playing catch up.

Enter my mom's boyfriend (M45), we'll call him Joe
 They have known each other through AA for a few years and started dating earlier this year. He is never married and childless. He works construction, not sure exactly how much he makes but we do know it's 80-100k a year. He owns his own truck outright and has a home with a mortgage and has made a point to mention he has no debt. He does have a sister (50) who lives with him and pays partial utilities and no rent he has cared for her for several years due to a disability. She can live independently and chooses not to as she doesn't like to rent from strangers.

Joe has stayed over at my mom's house at least 98% of the time since about May. He has seen her struggle with incoming and balancing bills and payment plans and is aware of the finical strain. My mother doesn't like asking for help and feels that since he has been used for money in the past by women and has his own household and bills she doesn't want him to feel an obligation.

He has recently started talking about long term and marriage. My mom likes the current two house situation so if she needs time away she can have it by sending him to his own home, but has talked to me about being ok with moving into one home if they are married but is again concerned about the finical situation.

The question is would she be in the wrong to expect Joe to offer to pay some sort of rent for staying with her the bulk of the time, or since he has yet to offer would she be wrong to ask him to help with bills if he's planning on furthering their relationship.

My husband and I are taking opposite sides of this, I may be partial to my mom though.",0,Female,original
"So I(24F) have been an atheist for a big portion of my life. However, I met my now fiancé (Just turned 30M) about 2 years ago now who is very spiritual. Since then I have come to be an agnostic pagan but I have not told my parents this. They wouldn't disown me or anything, but they already have issues with my fiancé because he isn't like them and I don't think they would really understand.

We intend to be engaged for a little while due to the \*\*\*\* and the finances but we have been seriously looking at a more pagan wedding and I recently discovered the handfasting ceremony. Which I think is absolutely incredible and I really want to do it. The best part is there are many versions of it and since it is reconstructed we can fine tune it to make it work for us. I also was never Christian and have a huge array of issues with it, it would feel weird to get married with a Christian priest who would might think I should burn in hell for existing.

This would all come as a huge surprise to my parents. But an even bigger surprise to any of my way more conservative relatives from other far away countries. I feel like it would come down to the ""Well we always wanted to see you get married like this..."" and some of my relatives are very old like my 90+ year old grand mother and some are religious etc. I just predict it being a huge mess.

Would I be TA if I still went through it and we started planning for that instead of a traditional wedding? Despite kind of knowing it will be protested against? Do I have to explain my self to my parents before hand?

"I dated ""John"" a couple of years ago and, just to sum it up quickly, the relationship took a huge toll on me. I lost most of my friends after we broke up because they ""sided"" with him (even though he broke up with me). My self esteem was gone. I questioned myself about whether I had been the problem. Even though we broke up a long time ago it's had lasting effects on me and has made it hard to form healthy new relationships. I recently started therapy and have been doing research, and I'm starting to suspect that it wasn't just a ""bad fit,"" but that John was emotionally abusive. 

John recently dated a new woman for a few months and I'll admit I snooped on her social media and found out that she has a YouTube channel. She doesn't talk much about her personal life there but on a recent video she mentioned an incident with her recent ex (John) that sounded so similar to things I experienced with him. I don't want to upset her or cause drama or come across as the crazy ex, but I have been considering reaching out to her and seeing if she'd be open to talking with me. I'd like to know what her perception of John was and whether she considered him to be emotionally abusive, because a big part of me still feels like I'm overreacting. I think I might be the asshole if I do this because I'm not actually sure that he was abusive and if he wasn't, I'm potentially spreading rumors about him that could damage his life.",1,Female,original
"I (26F) am married to my husband (27M) for about 2 years now. Our main problem in our marriage is my husband's friend (24F) whom I really don't care for. 

They used to be in the same unit together when he was in the marines. I have met her a few times but it was never a big deal because she was always just my husband's coworker. A year ago, she was in a bad relationship so my husband and I watched her dog so she could move out of the home the shared with her then boyfriend. 

Their relationship blossomed from there. Now they are in constant communication with each other, multiple times a day. Most of the time, it's multiple lines of communication at one time (EX: they will send memes to each other on Instagram, while also snapchatting, while also texting). Anytime she needs something, she calls my husband, no matter what time of day it is or what he's doing. She's called him for ""nutrition advice"" even though she has a trainer she pays $200 a month for this reason. She's sent him snapchats of herself crying saying how she just really needs someone to talk to so my husband has left the house, at midnight, to be there for her. It's even gotten to the point where he has had to tell her to stop calling him on the weekends so he could spend uninterrupted time with me. 

Everytime I bring up an issue I have with the boundaries of the friendship, we argue. He says it's because I always come off like I'm accusing him of doing something wrong. I've tried several different ways to approach the situation but nothing comes out right. 

I don't know what's the best way to handle this situation anymore. I feel like the jealous wife that doesn't want him to have female friends which isn't the case. I've told him multiple times I don't have a problem with her or the friendship, however our marriage needs to be respected at the same time. I understand she won't understand that because she's younger and not married. He wants to go see her next month but of course, I have no desire too. There was a time where I wanted go get to know her but now I don't know. I really need some advice so before we plan this trip I need to know, AITA?",0,Female,original
"For context, my boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) have been dating a couple of very short, very sweet months. Until now.

My birthday is the day before halloween. He had informed me we were invited to a party and my initial reaction was that of disappointment, as I’d honestly thought he’d have already made plans for us that night. 

We talked for a bit and came to a conclusion that we were both feeling a bit in disagreement and then we’d talk it over in person.

An hour later he declares he’s going to the party and he’s going to see his friends whether I like it or not. I’m upset. I’m hurt more than anything by his abrupt behaviour, and lack of consideration for me. 

We discuss and for some reason this time he’s not understanding. He isn’t apologetic despite how hurt I explain I am over his actions, and then from 8pm onward refuses to text me.

At 11 he says “he’s too stressed from work to deal with this, so night.”

We were awesome up until now, I was head over heels but he’s set to meet my mom tomorrow over thanksgiving (met my dad last weekend) and I feel very hurt and alone right now, kind of like I was tossed aside and not even worth a phone call.

I feel as though, if nothing else, an “I understand,” and an apology was needed from us both.

TL;DR: Bf and I got in our first fight, he treated me with blatant calleousness, and now I’m unsure he should even come over.",0,Female,original
"Hi everyone! Asking here if I’m (24F) the asshole.

My fiancé (27M) and I have four dogs, and a bird together. Our most recent addition is an 11 week old puppy. I handle all our pets general health care meaning vet visits, giving any medication, and making sure they’re on their correct supplements. 

I recently took our two older dogs (6M and 3M) to get boosters on vaccines, as well as their rabies, and heartworm testing done. While doing this, I thought it would be a smart idea to make a binder including all the individual pets past visits, as well as a brief summary for each pet on past illnesses/current medications/current feeding, and their overall temperament, to prepare anyone caring for our animals to be aware of everything. I also included pictures of each animal, and our own contact information.

When I showed my fiancé he told me this was “extra” and then implied he wouldn’t be taking/using the binder, and that it was almost demeaning to the vet staff. I thought this might make their jobs easier, but is it an asshole move to make a “guide” to my pets general information?",0,Female,original
"Girlfriend and I have been together for about 4 years and I have never met her parents. She told me she usually “screens” her boyfriends before even considering having them meet her parents because they are overprotective of her because she’s their only child.

Ok, I get that. If I was a parent I would want my child to have the best partner possible- someone who makes them feel wanted and loved. So apparently my girlfriends family had a different philosophy- they value power and money.

So when COVID ends, my girlfriend’s parents will be visiting her and I will meet them for the first time. She told me I have to change the way I look (to her standard) and that we would have to buy outfits to look “presentable” to her family and tell them that I have the role of manager at my job.

I told her I will not be doing that. I’m pretty comfy in my own skin and won’t be lying and spending money on clothes I won’t wear after they’re gone just to impress them. If they don’t think I’m a good partner for her because I treat her well and try my damn hardest to make her feel loved, then they are vain and vapid and only care about money. She said that I insulted her family and that led to a massive fight.

So AITA?",0,Male,original
"So the title is basically self explanatory. My (26f) boyfriend (30m) doesn't go out often, but almost every time he does he stays out all night. 

He works in a bar, usually clocking out around 11ish. Bars iny area close at midnight/1am, but he doesn't come home until 5, 6, sometimes 7am. 

He usually texts me and tells me he is going to someone's house for a beer and will be home in an hour or two, then goes radio silent and ignores any messages I send asking where he is if I wake up and try checking in, despite being online and seeing my messages. 

This usually leads to arguments where he calls me controlling, and I call him irresponsible. 

I don't know if I am being unreasonable wanting him to check in, or if I'm the asshole and being controlling for not wanting him staying out all night. 

AITA?

EDIT FOR CONTEXT:
It is currently 5.15am and I am getting up for work, with no sign of him. I sent him a message asking if he is coming home, and despite the app showing him as active 5 minutes ago he hasn't replied. He also has to go back to work in 6 hours.",0,Female,original
"For background I (m23) have been with my gf (f22) for about 3 and a half years now. We both live with our parents in a rural town without bussing and both our jobs are in the city about half an hour away. We've been looking for an apartment for the past little while but vacancy rates are extremely low in our area so it's been difficult. I drive my own car but my gf doesn't have a car or a license so she gets drives from her dad (m40something) whom I will call Al

I won't sugarcoat things, AL is terrible when it comes to finances and can be really stupid in general at somepoints. He even had to declare bankruptcy. He struggles to pay any of his bills and as a result, my gf and her older sister (f 23) are constantly bailing him out. As of now, they don't have internet, they go without hot water for weeks at a time and are now possibly going to lose their house. 

As of now, my gfs sister doesn't have any savings to speak of because she gives the majority of her paycheck to AL and the only reason my gf has any savings is because I told her she needs to put her foot down and start saving if we want to get a place. When you work fulltime and still live with your parents, its natural to give a few hundred bucks here and there to help but trust me when I tell you they were both going way beyond what is reasonable. I've voiced frustration over the situation before but of course, gf always defends her dad and then I drop it.

The situation reached a boiling point when AL was pulled over the other day for an expired registration sticker. It turned out he was driving without proof of insurance (fyi he has insurance, just didn't have proof with him) and his plate wasnt even registered with his car. Cops impounded it and now he's facing over 2 grand in fines he doesn't have. He doesn't have a credit card and now of course, gf and her sister have to bail him out again and I very much doubt he'll be able to pay them back. Gf was texting me about it obviously stressed because they cant get to work because of the car and I said ""im really angry at your dad right now. I can't believe he was that stupid, its exhausting see you constantly having to bail him out."" At which point, she stopped responding and haven't responded all day. 

Was I out of line? I can see how maybe I was being a bit harsh but everything I said is what I believe.",0,Male,original
"My bf (25) and I (24) are moving in into an apartment together soon. I will be bringing my bed, drawers, TV and dining table and chairs to save costs. He will not bring anything from his home. Mainly because my things are much more newer than his and his furniture are random colours. But also his parents doesn’t want to give it to him. We are both living with our parents still. 

So, I asked him if he could buy the sofa for the apartment (around $600) because I am bringing in most of the furniture. (We are still halving the other big expenses like fridge and washing machine). He immediately said no it’s not fair that it’s not halved with me. He said it’s my problem that I don’t want him to bring in his stuff just because I want the place to look nice and coordinated. And that those costs I helped us save doesn’t count as my part of the shared expense because I didn’t pay for it as my family bought it for me. AITA for asking him to pay for the sofa himself????

"So, this just happened and I'm angry and frustrated and my [f35] bf [39m] thinks I am TA.

So, we fell asleep snuggling together watching TV o  his phone. He dropped his phone on my face as we both fell asleep lol. Not a big deal, I wasn't mad about that.

He woke up and said sorry, I, still waking up, wasn't sure what was going on. I thought maybe it was a bug on my face or something so I started moving my hands in front of my face and flailing to try to get whatever was on my face off of it. When I realized what happened I said ""hey you dropped your phone on my face"" with a bit of an annoyed or upset tone. He said ""I SAID I WAS SORRY!"" Got angry and huffy and turned around and gave me the cold shoulder.

What frustrates me is, I don't find it fair that he dropped it on my face and is getting mad at me for not accepting his first apology quick enough. When I brought this up, I explained what I was startled awake with no idea what was going on, and it isn't fair to hold something against me when I had no real ability to not react because I was barely even awake.

When I brought this up he didn't see that as a valid reason. And it isn't the first time this has happened (involuntary reactions). 

AITH? Should I be able to control my reaction no matter what, regardless of if I'm sleeping  just waking up, etc.?

"My GF (39F) and I (34M) have been together for a little over 2 years now. We moved towns into a house her mother owns, that would otherwise be sitting vacant. We pay the mortgage and utilities as our ""rent"" as the end goal is for us to eventually outright own the home.

When my GF and I got together, she had told me that it had been almost a year since she had been able to see her family (a combination of distance and a raging narcissistic ex keeping her from being able to do so often.) This didn't sit well with me, so I took her on the hour-ish-long trip just to not only see her family, but celebrate her BIL's birthday.

When our own living situation, near the start of our relationship, turned sour, they took us in and we lived in the spare apartment-style basement in their home while the spare house was being readied for us to move in.

Just before COVID hit, I lost my job. Since my state was on complete lockdown, my only options were to try and find a work-from-home position. Unfortunately, this process took several months to find one; and we would barter favors instead of payments for the rent and utilities. It was a nice, tidy arrangement that worked well for all of us involved until I found another job. And, I did eventually find another job that not only paid well, but I absolutely loved.

After several months of medical complications, I went through the V.A. to check on V.A. disability, and found out that I qualified. Not only was I able to bring in money again, it was comparable to the job that I had. Life looked good again!

While she doesn't mind helping her mother (whom is not only getting up in years, but has severe health issues of her own,) her sister and BIL have a hard time being responsible for themselves.

Instead of asking my GF, now, if she's willing to do things, they end up voluntelling her that she's helping. Recently, she's been voluntold to help in two baby showers for people she barely even knows. I've almost been volunteered to help, but those had been kaiboshed due to my own appointments. This, of course, has forced the sister and BIL to ""make arrangements"" to rearrange themselves. When they say this, it makes it sound like we're the ones inconveniencing them!

I see it, every time, she gets voluntold to do something. She won't say no because it's her family, and because she's got such a large and sweet heart (which is the reason why I fell in love with her.) But it not only affects her physically, but also emotionally and mentally. She won't tell them no, which I feel only enables them to continue these behaviors.

"Background: my (37f) son (7m) would go to his dad’s (37m) just about every other weekend until he physically attacked his sister at his other son’s graduation party. He was then kicked out of his folks’ home. That was back in June and I had to go pick up my son since his dad was getting kicked out. 

He doesn’t pay child support or contribute in any way in raising our son. He hasn’t called to talk to our son or even ask how he’s doing (even before all that) and especially since. About a month ago, last minute, he text me if we had eaten lunch yet. I replied right away that we were heading to a birthday party, which we were. An hour and a half later he text back “k.” and then nothing. 
A couple Fridays ago, he text me at almost 6pm if we had eaten dinner yet. I replied that we had plans already, which we did. He wanted to have a meal and see our son- which I understand. 

I told him that our son deserves consistency and the best version of us and that he needs to focus on getting stable and then we can go from there. 

I know he talks bad about me, like I try and keep his son from him. I don’t. Our son doesn’t need to see that he’s been living in his car since June. 

Well, earlier this week he was arrested on felony charges. He called earlier while I was at work wanting to talk to our son. Since I was working, our son wasn’t with me. He called again later this evening. It sounded so phony. Like he only calls once he’s in jail to act like he actually cares, which he doesn’t. He just likes to feed his ego. 

I will add, he was very abusive to me physically, verbally and mentally when we were together and I got out once and for all when I had the chance. 

Would I be the AH if I told him that it’s not right to call only when he’s locked up? 

TLDR: son’s dad only calls after attested on felony charges to feed his ego or when it’s convenient for him to “try” to be a dad.",0,Female,original
"I have 4 kids (9, 7, 3 & 4m). As you can imagine life is pretty busy but I chose to have that many kids and I love it.

We have recently been in a Covid lockdown and had no school or daycare. It is currently school holidays. My husband does do his part for the kids where he can and he is a great dad but he is still working and the majority of the child care and housework falls onto me. This is how I like it but as anyone with multiple children knows, it’s also important to have an occasional break as well.

So to give us a break, my parents have taken my 3 older kids for a couple of days so I can spend some time with my baby, catch up on housework and hopefully get some time to relax.

So that brings us to the issue…today my FIL came over and brought my 10y nephew with him. Neither hubby or I knew my nephew was coming. I am usually happy for him to be here. He’s an only child and is going through some tough stuff at the moment so we have had him over more recently to give him a change of scenery and a chance to play with his cousins.

My problem with him being brought here today is that 1. FIL was coming around for hubby to fix his car and I asked hubby to ask his dad to not to bring MIL or nephew with him because I had things I needed to do today and didn’t have time to entertain them again as they were also over yesterday, and 2. My kids weren’t here for my nephew to play with so he ended up just wanting to talk with me (and boy that kid can talk loud!) which also woke my baby up. And 3. Hubby knows that I don’t like being surprised with guests (my introvert side needs to prepare for this!) but his parents do this all the time.

Mentioning this quietly to hubby had no effect so I decided to message my MIL because I didn’t want to say anything to FIL or talk on the phone in front of my nephew. I didn’t want to make a big deal about it so specifically said they didn’t need to take him home and he could stay here as I don’t want to make my nephew feel unwelcome, but I asked that they let us know in advance next time so we could plan to have him here or could let them know it wasn’t a good time for him to come over.

But my MIL called my FIL and they decided to take him home. I had a chance to quickly talk with my FIL and he seemed fine about it all. I’m usually a fairly non confrontational person and will often just go along with things but I felt it was important enough to me that I stood up for what I wanted.

After they left my hubby absolutely went off at me saying I was selfish and fat and lazy and a horrible person for making his parents feel like they needed to take my nephew away.

I think that I am justified in defending my very rare kid-free time.

But seeing as this has devolved into an argument between hubby and I, I need another opinion. So I’ll leave my judgement in your hands. AITA here?",0,Female,original
"Hi all, I am new to reddit and just discovered AITA. This is something that has been bothering me since I discovered it so I figured I would post here to see if this is an issue that I should pursue with my wife. 

My wife, Julie (not her name), and I recently had our first anniversary, while searching my email for the confirmation I found receipts for years worth of flowers to some woman. Specifically Mother’s Day flowers and they were each a couple hundred dollars. I asked my wife about it and she said “That’s Dave’s mom, I send her flowers and a card every year on Mother’s Day.” 
It is important for me to mention that Dave passed away before my wife and I met. It’s also important to mention that Dave had a daughter so it’s not like she has no one to wish her happy Mother’s Day. I mentioned this to my wife who said that Sarah is barely a teenager who has her own mom to deal with on mother’s day and that Sarah’s mom barely lets Dave’s mom see Sarah. She said that Dave’s mom has lost both her children and she wants to be sure that his mom doesn’t feel forgotten on mother’s day. Which I do agree with but I don’t see how that is our responsibility. 

I dropped it at that point because I felt like if I didn’t there’d be a fight, but here are my points. 

She doesn’t spend that kind of money on my mom or her own for mother’s day. And we aren’t exactly wealthy. She normally gives my mom a card for mother’s day which only costs a couple of bucks. Julie could send his mom a nice text or something to make her feel remembered. 

Dave’s mom DOES have someone, she has Sarah and a husband so it’s not like she’s some lonely old lady. 

My wife barely knows this woman. She lives on the other side of the country and the only time they met in person was for Dave’s funeral. It feels weird that she’s doing this for someone she barely knows. I think it may be more about her still having feelings for him. 

WIBTA If I brought this up to my wife again?

Edit:
Wow. Okay I get that I am probably TA, I do want to talk to her about it though because I do feel like she was hiding it from me (or at least not being super open about it.)

A few responses to people’s questions/assumptions:
Our finances are combined. These flowers DO exceed our agreed upon personal purchase limit. 
We are very tight with money, as in needing to prioritize bills to pay and putting a limit on groceries tight. 
Julie was never married to Dave so she isn’t a widow, but they were sort of living together when he passed so they were in a committed relationship. 
As for my mom, she a Julie get along fine, covid definitely put a dampener on them getting to know each other (we did the courthouse thing during the pandemic and haven’t had our reception yet, finances are still an issue as well as this whole delta variant.)",1,Male,original

Well he used some of his points to get his gf a plushie and got me one too and offered to get my bf one but bf didn’t want anything. All good but there was a squishmallow I was really eying so I got that. Well we get home and he tells me he doesn’t want me to keep it and is really rude about it.

"My (27m) fiancé (24f) and I recently moved in together. We have been together around 3 years and are recently engaged. 

We truly are best friends. We spend a lot of our time together but the perfect amount of time alone/doing our own thing. 

Moving in has been an adjustment for us. We struggle sometimes when it comes to decisions because we want different things. I.e, she wants a cat, I don’t want any animals at all. She has been trying to talk me into it but I don’t want one. Imo, the person who doesn’t want the animal is the person who should have the say given what a huge adjustment it makes to living situation. 

We also discussed our Christmas tree we plan to get and she gushed over getting a white one to match the way she has the apartment decorated (she has great taste and has it decorated very beautifully). I immediately told her that we would be getting a green tree because that’s the norm and that’s what I grew up with. She suggested we draw out of a hat to make this decision fair so one person isn’t having more of a say than the other. I told her we would see. 



Our newest disagreement is that she wants to smoke weed tonight when her sister comes over.

We smoke, but we use oil pens so there isn’t a smell. We specifically quit buying pot for our move in since we were renting an apartment now. Pot doesn’t bother me and I did it at my previous place but now that we’ve moved we don’t smoke it like that. 

Once we moved in, we quickly realized our neighbors smoke pot as well as a friend that lives nearby in the same complex. We can smell it every day, but we still just stick to our oil pens. 

The other night we went to dinner with her mom and sister and got fairly drunk. Her sister said she got a new bong she’d like to bring over soon and try just once and I said sure without really thinking. 

Well, her sister is coming over tonight and my fiancé texted me saying she was bringing the bong over for us to try. 

I told her I didn’t want it in the apartment because of the smell and she reminded me of the yes I gave the other night and said it won’t hurt being one time. I still am not comfortable with this because I don’t want it to smell, so she said she’d go somewhere in a car and smoke like a “child” even though she’s 24. She went on to say she has no say in anything and normal adults can do what they please in a place they pay to live in. 

She sent me a long text message saying that if I didn’t want it in the house it’s fine, but me agreeing and then saying no last minute messed up their plans for tonight. Her issue is “the principal of me changing my mind and thinking I can call every single shot as I please”. I think she’s being unreasonable and feel like I am well within my rights to not want that in my apartment, even if I agreed before. 

AITA here? She took my drunk yes and is now annoyed she has to go elsewhere to smoke.",1,Male,original
"To start off by saying that my boyfriend and I have a very loving and trusting relationship, we're both 29 and have been dating for a year, we've known each other for multiple years tho but got together last year.

My boyfriend has a woman best friend who he's really close to. The first months that woman and I got along really well although sometimes I caught her saying some shady stuff but I chose to brush it off as my own insecurity and said to myself it's not that deep. One day she casually mentioned she is very close to my boyfriend's sister and I said that's great, his sister is a really sweet girl. She then replied to me by saying ""You know his sister calls me sister in law right? It's a thing we say because she and I were convinced I'd date (boyfriend) at some point and get married."". It was totally unprovoked and I was taken aback. My boyfriend wasn't present at that moment it was just her and I grabbing lunch. I was very upset by what she said and I couldn't keep it from my bf so I asked him what his friend meant by that. He claimed she wasn't serious and it's just a joke but he can see why I'm upset and would tell her to not make that joke again.

Last week I had an accident and broke my leg and one of my arms. I was hospitalised and my boyfriend came to see me as soon as I notified him. I asked him if he wanted to stay the night in the hospital with me or if I should tell my mom to stay. He said he'd stay with me and my mom could go home. All that happened at around 10pm. At around 12pm he got a call from his bff and she told him she wants to go have some drinks because she's bored. He told her he couldn't come bc he's in the hospital with me for the night. When they hung up he was telling me she got upset and told me he'd go with her. At that time I got very mad and told him that I find it ridiculous how I sent my mom (which is a 1,5 hour drive) home so he could stay with me instead and now he wants to go for drinks because his friend got upset. He apologised and said he knows its wrong but also can't upset his friend because he can't bear to see her upset. I said what about me, your hospitalised gf? He told me I'm being selfish saying that. I then got even more mad and told him how I think his bff is using him for emotional comfort every time she's single and forgets about his existence when she's having flings with guys. Told him how she has always provoked me by saying shady stuff about me being temporary and her being the actual future partner of his. He basically implied I'm TA for speaking like that for his bff and for implying she's a manipulator who uses him.

"Sorry my English.   


Early this year, David, a friend of my husband, asked him if he wanted to be the godfather of his kid, (I think the kid is almost 2) and my husband said to me he didn't want to, so I  was like, say no if you don't want to.   


He has 2 ahijados already, and in catholicism that's a very big deal, I was raised catholic but don't believe in church and that stuff, so finally he was like, I can't support another ahijado because he likes to give gifts and take trips with them, so HE TOLD ME I'm going to say no.    


I thought that he said no and I was like good for you, but almost a week ago he said that he needed to buy the outfit for the kid and said that his mom convinced him, because if he say no to that, he will be look down by God 😒.

Today he said David wanted us in church this Sunday at 6am and I said that was to early for a baptism and he said is for the talks about being godfather and godmother, My husband said YES for me too. I don't want to go and he is mad that how is going to tell No to his friend.   


I  don't know the kid, I  don't like David or his wife, I visit them with my husband because he insist, but no one asked me if I wanted to be a godmother, and I can't do it because a godmother has to be close to the kid, and I don't tolerate churches, and my husband knows that, I'm super mad at him

"So my (29f) boyfriend (33m) has an old truck. He bought it for $600 a few years ago. It's rusted, dirty, and the breaks went out last week. So last month-ish it was struck my one of those individual apple sauce containers. He was incensed to say the least. So he put up a sound/motion camara on our banister going down the steps facing his truck. The problem is, when it goes off, he checks it, and if it's one of the neighborhood kids he watches, apparently waiting for one of them to say "" Remember when we threw applesauce at that dude's truck"", so that he can, and I quote, ""Scare them straight"". Originally he said he'd find out which bus stop they got off at to do so. Or maybe he'd just come barreling out of the house, idk. I told him he was delusional and if he carried out his plan he'll be labeled the neighborhood creep and we'll be lucky if they don't break out the torches and pitchforks (exaggerating a bit, I know) and he said that if he followed through the parents would even agree with him. He's got his friends saying he's right, but I still think he's full of it. Am I the asshole?",0,Female,original
"I am in grade 11 college chem doing stoichiometry. I have been struggling and behind on my work for the last little while and tonight it finally clicked and I was able to answer a question on my own which made me super excited. While I was raving about how happy I am to finally solve such a hard question, he came over and started hitting my vape and just staring at the question. (Keep in mind I’ve showed him the work from this course before because he is good with math and he had no clue and got the wrong answer!) he told me that the question was easy and he remembers doing it in grade 10, although he had no clue what to do in the much easier parts of the course so I don’t know why he would know what to do for this part.
He said it was super easy even though my chemistry teacher said himself that stoichiometry is hard and takes a lot of practice. So I asked my boyfriend “you have to find the molecular what in order to answer the question” and he said he forgot. I then asked him how you find molecular mass since it’s super simple and him being a genius he should know right, well he didn’t. So I told him next time he tells me the work I’ve been trying to figure out for days is easy, he better know how to do it.

Edit: I know I shouldn’t vape. I met an asshole when I was 11 who got me into smoking cigarettes and I haven’t been able to kick it since. And please don’t bash him because this really isn’t serious, I just wanna know if I’m the asshole.",0,Female,original

On mobile sorry for formatting. 

So my gf washed her hair today and it was curly, but she kept saying that she doesn’t like it that curly but I was saying that I do so don’t change it. 

She ended up straightening it even though I told her not to. After she was done I told her that I preferred it when it was curly and now she’s shouting at me calling me a lot of hurtful words.

"Hey Reddit! What’s going on? I’m in a little bit of a jam. 

Okay so a few nights ago me 22M and my partner 19F went to my school friends house for a party. We have been dating about 2 weeks and we have known each other for about 6 months. 

Her father has been a little suspect of me as I am 3 years older, which I totally understand because it played on my mind too before I asked her out. But she is just amazing in all ways and I can’t imagine myself with someone else. 

Anyway, the other night I took her too my mates place for a party as I wanted to introduce her to all my school friends. She checked with her old man and he said yes as long as she is back by 10pm. Another consideration is that she doesn’t drive. I say “yep no problem” and she agreed to. 

On the way to the party she tells me to just ignore her dad and have a few drinks and take her back in the morning. I protested and said no I want to earn her old mans trust and so him respect. This hurt as I wanted nothing more than to spend the night together but I felt it was right.

So 9:30 rolls around and I say to her “let’s go” I don’t wanna be late. I then turn to a mate and say “leave that whiskey for me I got some catching up to do when I get back.” She protests saying she is having a good time and that she doesn’t want to go. We talk, keep it civil and eventually she agrees and we leave.

In the car I explained to her my stance and reinforce how much I don’t wanna do this. She is just quiet, when I get to her place I walk her to the door. Her father answers said “thank you and what you’ve done means a lot,” I say “too easy” and accept his handshake. 

My partner is still a little annoyed hinting that she thinks this isn’t gonna work. 

I don’t want this to be over, she is amazing in every way, and I understand that what I did was sexist as I was putting the wants of the father over her, but I do not want him to stop me from seeing her as he didn’t trust me. 

So reddit AITA?

Just quick edit. Wow this got more attention then expected. Cheers for all your input guys!

Also wanna add: I made it clear to her when we were discussing this that this was only a one maybe two time thing, as I want her dad to a) trust me,  b) not worry about his daughter when we are out and c) she didn’t get shouted out when we got home so that we can spend more nights out together. This will not be occurring in the future. 

And I did not get any joy what so ever from doing this. It is the polar opposite of what I personally wanted to do! I just did what I felt was right so that we can continue seeing each other


Edit #2:
All’s good in the world! Just got off the phone from her and her old man. 

Her old man again thanked me, then told me that he will no longer be imposing any restrictions to us going out (Yay) and that apologised for putting me in a hard situation. He was just very wary of the age gap. He than left the room, or at least I hope he did haha. 

The better half than hoped on and said that she understood my reasoning and that he dad told her after I dropped her off that if I didn’t bring her back he would forced her to break up with me. After reflection from the posts here I apologised for heading back to the party, to which she responded “why shouldn’t you enjoy yourself cause my dads a downer.” We then had a laugh and made plans for tonight! No curfew in sight!

Edit #3: Thanks for all your guys input, however I have seen a few people placing my gf into an asshole category, which I think is a little unfair. I’m more than happy to accept I was somewhat of an ass and so was the father. However my gf is an awesome kind person who just wanted to spend time with me. In no way would she want to cause an argument with her old man over this cause she doesn’t like conflict. Please be understanding that she is from a strict household which makes it incredibly tough to stand up for herself. She is no asshole!",0,Male,original
"Throwaway account because my wife browses Reddit and knows my main

My birthday was last week. I know as you get older, people say birthdays become less and less important, but I grew up working class and birthdays could never really be celebrated, so I like to make up for it as an adult. I’ve kept a lot of the same interests that I had as a kid, so it’s pretty evident what I like (ie, I have a toooon of D&D figures and Pokémon card posters)

Anyway, I’ve been with my wife for 10 years now, 4 dating and 6 married. She has forgotten my birthday in the past, and it was pretty common to receive birthday gifts from her well into November. After the first couple of times I started leaving more reminders around the house when it was a couple weeks out, nothing massive but like writing “OP’s birthday” on the right date on the calendar. This time around I did the same thing, and the day came to pass and nothing happened. No “happy birthday”, no plans to go out or celebrate. 

I went and talked to my wife, and just gently reminded her that , “hey, it’s my birthday, maybe we could do something?”, and she immediately yelled at me to stop harassing her about my birthday, and called me an asshole for making her feel like shit for not getting me anything, and that, “you only care about the presents anyway.” I didn’t respond, just turned around and secluded myself in the office. I called my mom for advice and she said I shouldn’t have confronted my wife about, and that she probably felt suffocated from constant reminders of “something as little as a birthday.” AITA?",0,Male,original
"My Partner, 'Simon' (28M) and I (28F) have been together 5 years. We live together.


I work in a school so although I get a lot of holiday days, I am only off when the school is off.


One of Simon's uni mates is getting married in May. He's due to have his stag do in April. Simon doesn't see his friends or go away that often, especially recently due to the plague.


For starters this stag do- is SEVEN WHOLE DAYS. A Sunday to the following Saturday. 
So he has to use holiday off work. (The wedding itself is also a weekday so that's another days holiday to spend). Stags are ordinarily 3-4 days over a weekend.
It's over Easter Sunday and Monday as well so it's only four holiday days (out of his 25!) instead of 5, but ITS EASTER???


I'm upset he's having to use so much of his holiday when in all my previous jobs I have never had any. And because of the plague we haven't been able to do anything together but we were looking forward to 2022 because things should be better then.


The week Simon goes on this stag is a week I'll have off. We had a gig booked that week... and we were going to make a little city break of it (as it's not in our town). So that's another issue. I'm sure I can cancel it or bring someone else to the gig and go without a little holiday but that's just another bleh thing. The only money spent already was on the gig tickets and they were under £30 each.


The Stag do is in Inverness and we live in the South of England. So Simon is flying. We live about a 30-60 minute drive from the airport (traffic depending, but it's usually awful). Simon does not drive. Because it's Easter Sunday there will likely not be any public transport. I'm already angry at this whole situation but now Simon wants me to drive him to the airport on top of this. I have said no. I already obviously do all the driving for US (he has never asked me to drive for HIM in a similar situation) but doing all the driving for shopping, holidays, day trips etc is starting to get old after 5 years. Especially if we go to a nice restaurant so I end up not being able to have a nice wine.


I can't and won't stop him going but do I have any right to be upset and not drive him?


Some of my friends think I'm being selfish, but some others think the Groom is being selfish by asking a lot. Simon thinks I'm being selfish too. I do feel like a bitch, but I am really upset about being left for a week, wasting holiday and cancelling our existing plans. Because it's Easter a lot of my friends will be busy with family so I can't make plans with them.


Simon rarely spends time away so I know I shouldn't be pissed, but I am. I have even said to him before that I worry he doesn't see his friends much.",1,Female,original
"Throwaway: Me (25F) and my BF ""Darron"" (26M) have been together for 2 years. I also have a twin brother ""Jerry"" (25M) and we've always been quite close over the years. Darron has a pink teddy bear that he keeps in the livingroom, he got the bear from a girl when he was in the 1st grade. Darron was horrifically bullied all throughout school, and it's had a long lasting impact on him.

The day he got the bear, the whole class was doing some type of trading and sharing exercise. Well, everyone in the class traded/shared bears with eachother...except for him. Even his Teacher ignored him and basically told him to ""suck it up!"" Darron ended up crying alone during recess while the other kids played with their bears. Later that day, one of Darrons classmates came up to him and gave him one of her teddy bears.

Even though this happened a long time ago when he was little, he still remembers that day so clearly/fondly. Talking about it still brings him to tears sometimes, and I cried my eyes out when he first told me that story. His bear is very special to him, and he's kept it in near mint condition all these years. Yesterday, Jerry came over to our apartment to hang out and play videogames.

Jerry has never seen Darrons teddy bear, Darron always keeps it hidden in the closet whenever we have guests. Darron decided to keep his bear in the livingroom because he said he was tired of keeping it a secret all the time. After about an hour of playing videogames, Jerry took notice of the teddy bear. He said, ""Hey sis, when did you get this?"" 

Before I could respond, Darron said, ""Oh, that's mine."" Jerry looked confused and asked, ""Why do you have a pink teddy bear?"" Darron explained it by telling him the story about how he got it. Jerry then started laughing and said, ""Are you kidding? What guy keeps a toy that a girl gave him in the 1st grade?"" I could see that Darron was shaking and trying to hold back tears.

Jerry noticed this and said, ""Oh my god, are you actually crying? Who cries over a teddy bear?"" Jerry wouldn't stop laughing, so Darron just went into our bedroom. I snapped! I yelled, ""What the fuck is your problem?!"" Jerry said, ""Geez, I was just teasing."" I told him that he was just like all the bullies that made Darrons life a living hell! Jerry just kept saying that he was busting his balls and that I need to stay out of it.

I told him to get the hell out and never come back again! He got pissed and said, ""You can't be serious. I drove over 3 fucking hours to get here!"" I told him I don't give a shit and to get out before I call the Cops on him! He ended up going home and blabbing about me to our family and friends. He said that Darron and I were uptight and kicked him out over a ""harmless joke."" AITA?",0,Female,original
"Here is the people in the story me (20f) bestfriend (21m) and boyfriend (21m). So me and friend had a day planened jusr for me and him where we would go out and do fun stuff. It was all already planned and things that could be bought before hand were. Not really any changing of those plans. They were stuff we liked doing because well we thought it was only us 2 going. When I told my boyfriend I was going to be out for the day with him he looked kind of annoyed. I asked him why and he said I never try or ask to bring him to do anything like that. Also that I spend too much time with friend and he didnt like that. So I did what I could think of and asked him if he wanted to go with us. He said sure but still didnt look happy and I went to go ask friend if it was ok. When I asked friend sounded irritated also. I was confused because I thought they got a long pretty well but I was wrong i guess.

 The day we had the stuff planned we left and it seemeed to be going good because boyfriend also liked a few things we were doing. Later though it was more stuff me and friend only like and bf does not. When we would go he would say like he will just stay outside or go do something else while we do. Me and friend were having fun but it was apparent boyfriend was not. I asked him if he wanted to go anywhere and he just said no its whatever I dont care. After the day of stuff I told them I was going to be gone for a few minutes because I saw a girlfriend of mine. I was gone for about 15 to 20 mins. When I came back only friend was there and he told me what happened. They had started arguing because friend said that boyfriend was being jealous and shouldnt have come. That was like him he confronts people over things even if its better not to. I tolf him bye and went to go find bf. He was in the car and when I got he started to yell. That he shouldnt feel like a third wheel with his own girlfriend and that I shluld have told friend not to come because I know they dont like eachother. I didnt this was news to me they always acted ok to eachother when I was there not besties or anything but not rude. Also he said he didnt even want to come and why did I make him.

"Sometimes when I (29 F) am out at a bar or concert alone I start chatting with the people around me. NOT flirting, just normal conversation like “how many times have you seen this band? What other shows are you going to?” Etc. Occasionally the guy I’m talking to will ask me for my number when I’m trying to leave. 
Last night this happened and the guy was like, “hey we should meet up tomorrow for the next show! Let me get your number.” and I said sure and typed it in his phone, told him to have a good night, and left. I am 0% interested in this guy and have no intention of replying to a text if he were to send one. 
The reason I do this is because on several occasions if I have tried to politely turn down a guy by saying I’m not interested or I have a boyfriend for some reason they start acting aggressive, like I have done something wrong, and start cussing me out calling me a stupid bitch or similar. Other times they won’t take no for an answer and they will follow me to my car asking me over and over. It makes me really nervous when guys do this and when I’m alone somewhere (which I often am because I’m in a new city and my boyfriend (28 M) works graveyard shifts) and I know I don’t have anyone that I could call to come rescue me if things go badly I just give them my number to appease them so I can go on my way in peace. 
Why don’t I give a fake number? Because half the time they will call or text it while I’m standing next to them to check if it’s correct. 
I mentioned to my BF this morning that I did this and he was upset. I thought because we are in a loving and secure relationship that it would be no big deal and he would be more sympathetic that I have to deal with that sometimes. He said it’s emasculating that his GF is giving out her number to people and that I should just tell them no or give a fake number. I explained to him my reasons but he’s not okay with it and he said I should make an AITA post to prove him right.

"I recently got out of a toxic relationship (26F) in which I raised a puppy with my ex (28M) for nearly 3 years. Our breakup was not unexpected and I had been mentally preparing myself for months to finally cut him out of my life. I do think I dissociated myself from any emotional attachments I had for the dog.

My ex would treat the dog as solely his around other people, but would privately tell me that the dog was ""ours."" I would say that my ex had on several occassions used the dog to manipulate me into feeling guilt for wanting to leave the relationship. I guess at a certain point we both tried to force this ""bond"" between me and the dog because neither of us were ready to truly ""let go"" of the relationship.

I absolutely adored the dog and it truly was a gift to watch something so sweet grow up. At the time I was a struggling student with practically no income, so my ex legitimately was the dog's sole provider and caretaker. I had absolutely no problem with that, but found myself confused/frustrated when my ex would switch from him being the dog's sole owner to me being the dog's ""co-owner"" depending on his mood.

When I confided in close friends about this, I received silent judgement from them for not caring about the dog I helped raise for almost 3 years. AITA for no longer caring or missing the dog?

EDIT: I want to add that prior to leaving the relationship I knew that the dog was in good hands. My ex was not the most reliable or responsibile person, but he did make an effort for the dog. His parents also frequently let the dog stay in their home (with their other dogs who all get along) and took great care of them. The ex's parents treat the dog like it's their grandchild.

"I'm a single dad with 2 kids who has a financially dependent ex wife. She rarely worked, even before the kids were born. Even though we initially agreed to both contribute financially since we were married and she lived with me. I ended up having to work extra hours to pay all the bills and mortgage on our house. Once the kids were born it got even worse. She wouldn't contribute a dime towards child care. I had to cover everything. As well as groceries we used for the kids. She worked a part time retail job while the kids were in daycare and she spent all the money on things she wanted while I was left footing the bills for our kids.

I had to eventually work overtime to the point where I could barely spend time with our kids. I couldn't afford us going out on dates anymore. She's never contributing towards a single date during the relationship nor marriage. I tried having a talk with her about this but she still refused to contribute financially towards the kids, bills, date nights, and she was comfortable with me continuing paying for everything at the expense of me not having time with our kids.

This led to the divorce in which she tried to take everything from me including the house which is in our name but I pay for. And the car which I also paid for including the insurance and gas. She got the car but not the house thankfully. She's apparently now remarried to a man who also has a good job like me and from what I found out, she quit her job but still sends the kids to daycare/school which I still pay for. I also pay for extracurricular activities, school supplies, medical co-payments after insurance, and so on.

A year ago I met a beautiful, smart and independent woman who's been a great partner. We don't live together yet but she occasionally helps with groceries when she visits and she's contributed to a decent portion of our dates. She recently admitted to me though that she's envious that my ex-wife doesn't pay anything to me and never did even when I was married. I feel bad. There's a couple more upcoming dates we were planning that will have to suddenly be put on the back burner because I have to cover the full expense regarding the kids of something my ex (their mom) was supposed to cover with me. We have 50/50 custody.

My girlfriend is an angel, and has covered many dates, including some groceries even though she doesn't live with me. I too have covered many dates between us as well. I feel bad for asking but I'm currently in a very rough financial spot because my ex will never financially contribute towards our kids. AITA for asking my girlfriend to pick up the next few date checks, if not postpone? If we postpone, it may be months before I can take her out on another date unless she chooses to take me out again. Also asking her for a few groceries? Not much, just a bit? My ex quit her job and spends her money. I can't force her to financially contribute to our kids. Also, in the divorce agreement, her lawyer put in a fine print clause that says the custody arrangement  can't be changed.",1,Male,original

Nothing is detrimental, but we could be in a much better position than we are. 

Our biggest issue is my mental health problems which stem a lot from my environment. When I'm in a productive environment when I can control the outcome I am rarely unhappy.

"Last month, I was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  I'm only 42 (kidney cancer under 45 is rare; so I definitely qualify as a ""young"" case).  Next week, I go in for an operation where they'll cut out either a part of or all of one of my kidneys.  After that, we'll try to figure out if it's spread at all and whether I'll also need further treatment like chemo or radiation.

Obviously, I'm not in a good place mentally.  I was having serious problems with sleep and work.  It's terrifying.  So I got some anti-anxiety medication to get me through the time until the operation.  It dulls my terror and lets me sleep.

My wife told me she hates who I am when I take it.  I'm apparently ""emotionless"" and ""cold"".  I told her I don't want to stop taking it.  It's only another week and she just needs to accept that this is something I absolutely need right now.  She says that I'm emotionally abandoning her and only thinking of myself instead of how all of this is affecting her as well.  I get that this is hard on her too and I can't offer her the support I normally would in hard times - but I just don't get how she doesn't realise this is harder on me.  This is happening to me.  I'm going to go through a major surgery with a painful recovery period and my life might never be the same.  I might then have to go through treatment that will make me really sick and even then I might just die at the end of it all.

I give her hugs and kisses and reassure her it'll all be okay.  But yes, I recognise the medication makes me less emotional.  That's the point of it.  It stops me from crying all night.  It stops me from obsessing over my mortality and allows me to do those things.  So while I might not be as emotionally present, at least I'm still able to do them, right?

"Me (20f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been dating for about 5 years now and everything is great, except for my relationship with his family.

The issue is that they have political views that clash with my own. For example, they often use slurs, say the N word as a joke when referring to each other and call sex workers ""wh\*\*\*s"". They also believe that all poor people are just lazy, that trans women are only pretending so they can go into bathrooms and SA young girls, that women who are SAd often deserve it because they led the men on, that immigrants should be sent out of the country and/or shot etc. For further context, my family is also lower class New Zealand Maori and I'm bisexual, so a lot of the time their comments really sting.

They have also been casually racist to me on occasion, but I don't think there was ever any malicious intent behind it and they genuinely did not know that what they were saying was racist. They have also always been nice to my face. They invite me to all their events, engage me in conversation, and are just generally really kind to me.

However, I just can't seem to separate them from their political views and have started to take a disliking to them that's become quite obvious to everyone. I've been very short and curt when speaking, I refuse to see them or go to their house and if I'm there I mainly stay on my phone the entire time. It's gotten to a point where my coldness has made them quite upset and they've messaged me asking why I don't like them anymore.

She seemed finally ready to do something about it and took a pretty drastic move and asked if she could move in with me with the idea being that I'd get her in the right direction and set it up to where, eventually she could go at it alone. She wanted to move in because, a lot of her binge eating I guess happened alone so the idea on her end was, if she's not alone, she won't binge.

She told me it'd be great for her, she was going to be rejuvenated, she wanted to make me feel like me helping her was worth it. Well, she's lived with me for 4 months and it's been a disaster. She always makes excuses for why she can't exercise, she doesn't respect me labeling food in my fridge, she argues or just ignores my suggestions of 1 cheat meal a week, which has now become, cheat whenever.

I got to a point where I told her she has 1 month to turn things around, or she's leaving. She argued that I'm being unsympathetic to her issues and that I need to be more understanding.",0,M,original
"My girlfriend Anna (36) and I have been together for 5 years and we have an 8 month old baby. 

Before we were together, she married at 24 to a man named Greg, who sadly passed away 2 years later from a work accident. Anna was really affected by his death, of course, and she remained close to Greg's family in the years since.

Honestly, I have always felt second fiddle to Greg. She never wanted to get married to me, despite marriage being important to me, because she said she only ever planned on getting married once, and intends to keep that plan despite her husband dying. She still sees Greg's family regularly, and she is even part of their family Zoom calls, whereas she never seemed to give the same effort to know my parents.

We had our son 8 months ago. Recently, with restrictions easing up, she has been taking our son to see Greg's family. Last week I went with her for the visit, and I noticed that she's been calling Greg's sister ""Auntie June"", and Greg's parents ""Mimi and Pop Pop"", which weirded me out because they are NOT my son's aunt or grandparents. 

When we got home I told her that I don't want our son to be visiting them all the time, because it bothers me that they see my son as part of their family. Anna got mad at me, saying that since she's kind of their daughter, our son kind of is their grandson too.

Well, that got me really mad, as it just felt like one more way that Greg is still involved in her life, and that I'm just some kind of replacement. It bothers me that we have started a new life together, yet she is still clinging to her old life.

We had a big fight, and it's still going, as she still wants our son to see ""her family"", and I'm still upset that she insists on keeping her former in-laws so close to her and our son.

"TLDR - AITA for wanting to know if there's been a change of plans for my spouse's evening before/while it's happening?

Okay, my husband was out of town at a convention this past weekend and they have agreed to isolate away from everyone in the home for 4-5 days (I have an unvaccinated child). The event was vaccinated individuals only, husband was vaccinated in May, and also had covid about 3 weeks ago (hence the shortened quarantine). 
Husband works as a food delivery driver and didn't post a schedule for this week but instead can ""pick up"" shifts nightly (in case they do get sick this will keep them from having a call-out on their work record). Yesterday Husband left early to go hang out with Buddy before work. Husband was going in to work at 5, but didn't get to Buddy's place until just after 3 because of a previous appointment. When husband left I told him I loved him and that I hoped he had a good night at work, husband said thank you and went about his day. Husband returns home about 9:30-9:45 last night (normal time for them to return home from working) and I ask him how work went. He told me that he ended up not picking up a shift and hanging out with Buddy and Buddy's neighbor the whole evening. It was the first I'd heard of it and I'm not really sure how I feel because:
- It's not like husband and I could have spent any quality time together anyway because they are isolating away from myself and my kids.
- As long as they can pay their half of the bills the money thing isn't concerning to me.
- I was busy all afternoon anyway working on various projects around our home. 
- I wouldn't have said anything like ""No you can't hang out with Buddy"" because I'm not husband's mom and they are an adult with their own autonomy, but a quick text message would have been appreciated.
- Seriously just a quick ""I got over here late so I'm not working and am hanging out with Buddy instead"" just as an FYI would have been enough. I would have wished them a great evening and thought nothing more about it.

More explanation-
So, we've genrally given each other an update of what's going on plan wise. We rely very heavily on transparency because we're also in an open relationship and without that transparency and lots of communication our relationship would suffer. I thought a lot about it before talking to my husband and asked if they would feel comfortable just shooting me a quick heads up when there's a schedule change like that. I also told them that I understood if they didn't want to do that and I would adjust and move forward. But that because historically we've always just given updates about what we're up to and if things change, it was a precedent that created an unspoken expectation. 
When we were talking about it they obviously got agitated (I asked before we even started the conversation whether they had the mental energy to talk) and kept asking what my reasoning was and where the line was as far as what they should report. When I would try and respond they would interrupt me and keep telling me I was not answering their question. 
After about 5-6 times being unable to finish a sentence they accused me of becoming angry and aggressive. I told them I was getting frustrated because they were interrupting me and they finally let me talk. 
I gave them the option to tell me it's something they didn't want to do, and we would move forward accordingly. Instead they said that when they shared their plans it was a ""gift"" of information they were choosing to share, accused me of trying to be controlling, and of letting my anxiety dictate the conversation. 

So, am I the asshole for asking my spouse if they felt comfortable sharing if plans changed as a sign of courtesy, respect, and transparency?",0,Female,original
"We (F30 and M39, together around 2 years) have both been under a lot of stress lately. 

On Wednesday, I started feeling really, really weird, due to a prolonged stress and it's consequences. I felt weak, fatigue, and dizzy, and was not sure how I would survive the day.

I asked my boyfriend if I could spend the night at his place since I was not feeling well and was not sure how I will manage the evening. I have fainted in random places a few times before, and one time it almost costed my life (because I fainted in the middle of the street). I also get bad headaches from time to time.

When I texted my boyfriend this, his response was a bit cold and harsh. Instead of comforting me, he started questioning if I was actually feeling that bad and whether I really needed his assistance etc.

He also added that if it is absolutely necessary, it's ok for me to go to his place but he won't be able to chat with me and that, in near future, he will need more alone time than what he is getting now. Before this, he had not bring out this need and on Tuesday, was more than happy to have sex and chat with me etc. So I felt that his words came out of nowhere.

I got pissed off, and revealed to him that I found his approach quite hurtful but will leave him alone and sleep at my place. However, we did not have a proper argument about this, just a few not-overtly-friendly words.

Next day he did not send me anything but I eventually had to ask him something. We had a short chat about mundane things and such.

Today, I was supposed to go and get something important at his place but felt too tired to go there and come back at my own place. Instead, I asked him if I could visit his place when he was on his training on Sunday.

He seemed confused and said that I did not have to go back to my own place but could have stayed at his place etc. I told him that it does not feel like a good idea now.

Usually we spend time together on weekends so I know that by choosing this timing we will avoid meeting each other altogether. 

However, now, after my anger has calmed down a bit, I am starting to wonder if I was too harsh on him. I found his response pretty hurtful but perhaps I should try and be more mature about this. I do feel that I am punishing him but at the same time, I feel like he is acting equally badly towards me.

"I'm 37F married to my husband 36M. We have a 1-year-old.

He works full-time. I work part-time (remotely) and am enrolled in a graduate certificate program, so basically full-time hours. We are American expats living in a country where household help is affordable, so during the week we have a nanny/housekeeper 8 hours a day.

I have ADHD and struggle with focus, so it takes me a long time to get work done. Often I will be finishing up work or school projects in the evenings or on the weekends. When the nanny is here I am not always working or completing class work, I'm also getting groceries or doing other household tasks. 

My husband hates that I sometimes have to finish work in the evenings or on the weekend because it usually means he has to watch our son - although I try to do as much as I can while the baby sleeps. His job is demanding, so he is often tired and he wants to sleep late and play video games and relax. Last week he asked me to ""promise"" to get all my work done during the week so that I'm free on the weekends. I said repeatedly that I don't like to make promises like that because circumstances can change from week to week and I might not always be able to keep my promise and also stay caught up with work and school. Like, our nanny could be out sick or something. He kept demanding that I promise and wouldn't let up, so I finally got exasperated and said, ""Fine!""

This week was a big national holiday in the country where we live, so our nanny was out Monday and Tuesday. I had to finish a school project on Sunday but I didn't do any work at all on Monday and Tuesday because it was family time. This meant that I fell a bit behind, so yesterday I was trying to show him all the work I still had to do and explaining that I would probably have to be working a bit this weekend in order to complete everything.

He was upset and disappointed and said that I broke my promise not to work on the weekends. I said that I shouldn't be held to that this week because I had only 3 days to do everything instead of the usual 5, and that he should understand that and be flexible. He said it's my responsibility to figure that out and not his problem. I also told him that I felt like it was unfair that he basically bullied me into making that promise and that I didn't want to make it in the first place.

"My wife and I got married 4 years ago.  She had 2 kids from a previous relationship (now 8 & 10) that she has full custody of.  Their dad is not much of a figure in their lives.  I inherited my parents' house when they died about a decade ago and since my wife and her kids were living in an apartment, we decided it would be easiest if they moved into my house after we got married.  The kids now have their own rooms, there's a yard for them to play in, we got a dog, it's been really nice.

About a year ago, my wife's dad got sick and passed away.  It's been hard on a lot of her family members, but especially her mom.  A few months ago my wife brought up the idea of having her mom move in with us so that she wouldn't be alone.  I was very hesitant since her mom has her own health issues and adding another adult to the house changes the dynamics of the household completely.  

After a lot of discussion and pressure from my wife, I finally opened up to the idea, but there are still roadblocks.  The biggest being that we do not have a spare bedroom for MIL.  My wife's idea is to make the basement a kind of MIL suite.  However, I have spent the last decade turning the basement into my man cave.  Think bar, pool table, poker table, big screen TVs, etc.  I did a lot of the work myself and I'm pretty proud of it.  

I told my wife that it's pretty much a non-starter for me to give up that space as it's something I've been working on for a long time, since before I even met her.  My solution is to have the kids go back to sharing a room and MIL gets the other bedroom.  My wife said that her kids have gotten used to having their own space and she won't force them to give that up.  

I asked her why it's ok for me to have to give up my space, but not anyone else?  I told her I am the one who is gaining nothing from having MIL move in.  MIL would get to be around family, my wife gets her mom close, kids get their grandma, and I would have to give up something that I worked long and hard for?  Doesn't exactly sound like a sweet deal for me.

She called me a selfish asshole and told me I'm being ridiculous and stubborn.  She told me that this is now her house too and she's not going to make her kids sacrifice their space when we have a perfectly good space that MIL could use.  I told her that the basement is the one place in the house that I do not want changed, under any circumstances, no exceptions.

We've been fighting about this for weeks with neither of us willing to budge.  My wife is getting more and more hostile towards me and our relationship is suffering.  Do I just need to bite the bullet and give up my space?  I think I'm already giving up a lot by allowing MIL to move in with us, but am I being an asshole about this?",0,Male,original
"My boyfriend rarely talks about work. I know he hates it there and his boss is an absolute asshole.

I had seen similar things happen and I know men who pretend like they will stick up for you and then have no shame in fucking you over. I told him that it was really cowardly of him and he could have at least tried to defend her. 

He got upset. He told me he knew he was an asshole and he didn't need me to tell me that he was one.

"My husband (we separated a year ago but for simplicity’s sake let’s just call him that) was involved in an accident two months ago. His family called me and asked me to bring our kids to see him, which led to me reluctantly moving back in with him to take care of him.  

At one point, it was just the two of us and I made a comment about how his face now matched what was on the inside. Before the accident, we were going through a nasty divorce, and he was doing everything to make my life as difficult as it could be. He also was a huge jerk before we officially separated too. My husband is very good looking but after the accident his face was bruised and swollen so he didn’t look his best. 

My comment got under his skin because he called me vindictive and petty and asked me if I was enjoying watching him in pain.

"I (22F) have my birthday coming up in a few weeks. My boyfriend (23M) that I've been dating for half a year now has a dog.I usually don't mind having them both over (we don't live together), but I asked him to leave the dog home for the night of my birthday since I don't have a large house and my family will be coming over and thus the situation will be hectic. 

I am a bit uncomfortable with dogs since I feel responsible for the animal, and my BFs dog is notorious for snagging food. Other that that the dog is really well behaved, but when me and my BF are together I always unconsciously watch the dog which takes a lot of energy from me, as if I'm looking out for a child. 
As I said, when we're at regular social gatherings or when we're seeing each other I don't mind: I knew the dog was part of the relationship when we started. 

I'm worried that I'll be too tired to celebrate my birthday properly when he comes over with the dog though. I'm an introvert so bigger social gatherings are a slight challenge to begin with, and I'll have finished a full day of work before my family comes over to celebrate (they insisted they had to see me on the day itself, otherwise I would have moved it to a more convenient time and date).
On top of the fact that I am scared that the dog's prescence will tire me out it also weighs heavy on me that half of my family does NOT like dogs: I don't want them to be uncomfortable in my house when my partner brings his pet over.

I asked him if it was possible if he could find a sitter or a friend for that evening, but he looked very disappointed saying that it would be a lot of trouble for him to find someone to watch the dog. He hoped that he could stay the night with me and now that I don't want the dog around he probably has to go home after a few hours. I said that that was fine but he seemed extremely bummed about it.

I really feel like an ass for asking him to leave the dog for a night, but on the other hand I really do not want to ruin my own birthday just because he can stay over an extra night that week. AITA?",0,Female,original
"I am a short woman (5’0) and my husband is a tall man (6’8) who has back problems - so he likes EVERYTHING on the top shelf. Or on top of the cabinet itself


Obviously this bothers me since I literally cannot get what I need to get. And it’s not just the stuff he uses (since he doesn’t cook anything. I do all the cooking. And he doesn’t get any snacks or stuff out since I make his lunch for work).


**So a few weeks ago I woke up when I heard his alarm - so that I could make him his lunch before he went to work. As I was getting out the stuff, I try to mix it up so he doesn’t get bored of the same things. So I went to get him a snickers bar, but he put the candy bar box on the top of the cabinet, and long story short- as I was climbing up to get it (mistake in hindsight) I fell off, and broke my wrist trying to catch my fall.**


My husband puts things up there because he has struggled with his back due to an injury that occurred at work. So he avoids bending over. And he refuses to get surgery to repair the disc. And I could’ve gotten something else to add ik it’s place for his lunch. But I didn’t. And broke my wrist falling down. It’s sort of my own fault, but I feel I’m justified in being upset. And I am currently not speaking with him since he stopped laughed when I told him (crying) what happened instead of calling someone, or doing something.


I’ve told him not to, and I admit that it’s my fault. But I think him laughing at me was wrong. Especially since he just texted my sister to, “handle it”. grabbed his lunch and left. And then wondered why I was upset with him.


**I’d like to say in my husbands defense: it wasn’t a situation where he walked in saw me crying and broke down laughing. It was more of a situation where he laughed when I told him what happened**


**And he then told me he couldn’t miss work, and called my sister before leaving for work. He also plucked the snickers from the top of the cabinet and threw it in his lunch box before zipping up and walking out the door.**",0,Female,original

Throwaway for obvious reasons!

My husband is a cinnamon roll and just such a wonderful person. We’ve been inseparable since we started dating years ago and he’s my best friend. That’s why it makes me feel so horrible to think anything even remotely bad about him!

I guess I’ll dive right in:

The man cannot hold a tune to save his life. I feel so guilty writing this but it’s true! When we were younger he wanted me to teach him how to sing and I tried but it just didn’t work and he got frustrated and stopped. He’s a little sensitive to any criticism or to not doing something good the first time. I’ve been in chorus at school, choir at church, and taken music lessons my entire life. He didn’t really even listen to music before we met. 

Still, if I sing then he joins in, and I don’t usually mind! It’s actually really fun! We are always together at home so we sing together often!

Recently I’ve been honing my vocal skills and recording myself singing. I’d like to upload to YT and SoundCloud someday. I’ve been too shy to try before but I think I’m decent enough to now. My husband has been nothing but supportive, which is why I feel so bad about the prospect of asking him not to join in whilst I record. 

His feelings will for sure be hurt by this no matter how I ask…

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been unable to get a single good recording unless he’s at the store. Songs are usually 3 minutes and since my husband is always around me I can’t get thorough a whole song before he sings very loudly over me. I can hear him well from other rooms. He also sings mumbly because he doesn’t know all the words. It messes me up. I try really hard not to show my annoyance at this. I try not to even get annoyed at all but i do anyway and I’m sorry for it. 

WIBTA if I asked that he refrain from singing unless it’s outside of my little recording area? I don’t want to hurt his feelings… but I don’t want to give up recording either. I don’t know what to do.",0,Female,original
"Last year (before the pandemic) my boyfriend (M19) took me (F17) to see their house in the USA, and I was beaming with joy from the invitation. The trip was amazing and he introduced me to his family and friends there — the most important one to this story is Lisa (F19), old friend and stuff.

One day, the three of us were hanging out in his parents house. For a moment he had to leave and Lisa and I were talking, until she said something like “you know he’s only with you because I denied dating him, right?”. I was taken aback obviously and she kept on saying that he was in love with her since they were child and since she never felt the same, he decided to take me in as a filler but would never love me as much as he loved her. According to her, that is if he loved me at all, because he was all alone in another country, he was probably just desperate to connect with someone and I was the first one who stomped through his way.

Not gonna say that it fucking hurt. Day went on, when we were set to sleep I commented on what Lisa told me and he got shocked and absolutely furious. He denied everything she had said and comforted me the best he could, the next day he called her almost yelling and just excluded her from the tour he had reserved for us.

Before I left, I saw her once again because his parents invited her for dinner and she didn’t lose a chance there as well and completed saying that if it wasn’t true, “he wouldn't have been so bothered”. I said she was crazy.

Well, for some weeks, his parents came to see how his life was in here (my country). But, he ended up having some issues with the house he was renting here. He said he was going to stay for some days with his parents in a hotel and I invited him and his parents to stay with me and my family so they wouldn’t have to spend money. They were really thankful, but then he told me that Lisa was here as well. Turns out his parents invited her and another friend of his which had family in another state so they could catch up.

I commented to him that I wasn’t comfortable being around her for another week, especially because I know that she might keep on saying stuff like that. He said that it wasn’t a problem at all and asked the other friend if she could stay with his family instead, he accepted. But, on the next day, I received a whole bunch of angry texts from her calling me a bitch and all its synonyms. She said that I was just in denial and that I should accept the truth and ditch him before he came into reality that I was just a whore who wasn’t worth his time. And said that once his change ends, he’ll dump me and find “some white girl who would be 100% better than me”.

Well, I don’t really think I am the asshole. Especially because she was clearly racist. But my boyfriend’s mother commented that it was actually unfair of me to separate them, since she came only to stay with his friend and now she is a state away. His father agreed.

"For context I’m a black woman and my fiancé is a Mexican man. We’re both pretty young too. When I first met his sisters and his mother we all hit it off great, they love me and accept me like I’m their kin. When I met his oldest brother for the first time I thought it would be the same thing. My fiancé doesn’t get along super well with him but I still tried to be as polite and positive and respectful as possible. He was cordial but kind of curt when we first met but I assumed he just felt a little awkward. Come to find out, he thought I was kinda crazy because I was so peppy and high energy. I was told that after i went home. A couple weeks passed and I met him again at his mother’s house while hanging out with my fiancé. It seemed to go well until, once again, I found out otherwise. When I was there I noticed a $100 bill laying on the TV stand. I never touched it or even thought of taking it, but after I left he made a joke to my fiancé about how he’s glad it didn’t get stolen since “Ya know…” My fiancé told me straight away and made sure his family knew what had been said. But he never apologized to me and when he went back to his house (he lives in another state) his family threw a little going away party for him but I didn’t go because i don’t like him and i don’t want to be around someone who thinks that way about me. Turns out he apologized to his whole family, but never once apologized to me about what he said about me. He’s back visiting this week and I didn’t speak to him or address him when I saw him, but his mother and sister want me to forgive and forget and not hold grudges since he’s their family and I’m going to be too. I don’t forgive people without apologies because I believe in consequences for your actions. I told them I can’t make any promises and I left the get together not long after the conversation. They seemed upset about my answer. Should I just let it go without an apology?


Edit: so I was wrong about the joke he made…it was SUBSTANTIALLY worse than I had remembered. My fiancé reminded me that he actually said, quote “oh look my money is still here.

"On saturday I (22M) took my girlfriend ""T"" (20F) to meet my group of friends. We went to a bar, and I was happy to see everyone getting along. 

At some point I went to the bathroom and when I got back I saw that my friend ""M"" (23F) had taken my seat next to T. 

For info, I have untreated ADHD and started relying on nicotine at a young age to help me deal with it. T says she doesn't mind me smoking, but I avoid it when I'm with her seeing as she doesn't smoke herself, which in turn makes my hyperactivity unmanageable. But for some reason her presence feels really grounding to me, and I started to unconsciously reach towards her to keep my hands occupied. For example I fiddle with her necklace or bracelets, or play with her fingers and rings when I'm holding her hand. She picked up on it, but she encourages me to keep doing it. She sometimes gives me herself her hand when she notices me reaching for my pack of cigarettes. It's working well, but it means I'm almost always touching her when we're together. 

So back to the bar, I accused M in a playful tone of stealing my seat and she replied very seriously that ""that way you will stop having your hands all over T for two seconds. I know I was not the only one here feeling uncomfortable"", which annoyed me because it's not like I had been making out or touching T inappropriately. I don't think playing with her jewelry would make anyone uncomfortable, which is really the only thing I had been doing. 

I told M that, and also explained that it's something we came up with together to help me with my ADHD. It turned into a full bloom argument after she replied that it's kinda weird to use my GF as a fidget toy and makes me look very possessive and dominant over her, even like I'm treating her as a pet. We went on for a moment while everyone else stayed silent, until I got too fed up with M and finally sat down at her previous seat at the other end of the table. 

The rest of the night was awful. I was all over the place, and couldn't resist smoking again. T had completely shut down. I wanted to get her away from there, so we left, fully aware that I was supposed to drive three of my friends (M included) back as well, but I couldn't care less at that point. 

Later on, T said that M made her feel self-conscious and humiliated, and that she also felt guilty for making everyone uncomfortable and being the cause of the argument. I told her that she did nothing wrong and apologized for putting her through that but she keeps blaming herself, which makes me blame myself. 

In my opinion M was out of line, but maybe my way of coping with my hyperactivity is indeed inappropriate around other people or irrespectful of my GF. What I regret the most is reacting impulsively and causing a scene, putting T in a situation where she felt uneasy and then leaving instead of driving my friends home safely.

"My boyfriend of one year has been staying over my house on the weekends since our relationship started. Recently, his laundry has been piling up at the house. Whenever I check the hamper, it’s mostly his clothes. I’ve asked him to take his dirty laundry home instead of leaving them here because I don’t want to do them anymore. 

He implied that I was a bad girlfriend for telling him to take the dirty clothes home, but I’m tired of being his personal laundromat. My water bill has gone up because he showers twice a day here too. 

He said this was the least that I could do because he helps out when he’s at the house. I only ask him to help me take out the trash bins weekly (and I go with him) and do the dishes (when it’s mostly his dishes in the sink!). Other than that, I do all the chores myself. 

Am I the asshole?

Thanks

UPDATE: thank you everyone for your reply and contribution. The boyfriend and I decided to end things. It was a mutual agreement and it was for the best. I need to date on my level.",0,Female,original
"GF (25) and I (25m) been together 8 years and last year spent our first Christmas together with her mum.

Both of our parents are divorced but naturally I assumed that we would spend this Christmas with my mum, especially as she has only just recently got divorced from my dad (a poor husband and father) and so did she.

Except she just told me that she has been thinking about this for 10 months and will most likely be in tears on Christmas day as a result of not being with her family.

I love Christmas and am used to seeing lots of different people at different times and it being no big deal but it seems to be very very important to her.

AITA for saying she's being a bit dramatic about it?

Feels slightly insulting to my family, especially after everything they have been through in recent history.

It's not like we wouldn't see her family either, it just might not be for the whole of Christmas Day.

She now won't talk to me about it and says I'm really uncaring and horrible

"I (28M) and my wife (28F) have been together 10 years, have been married for 2 years and have a 3 month old son.

A few days ago my wife told me that her cousin and cousin’s husband started looking for beach houses in North Carolina and that some of her friends and extended family were thinking about getting the place during the summer of 2022. My wife showed immediate interested in this and I did not. She knew that I wasn’t interested in going.

Today she showed me the beach house they want to get. Her cousin’s husband picked the house out. It is a massive house with a ton of features and an amenities. We did not get any input on the location, type of house, features or amenities that we would be paying for.

I don’t want to go though. There are a few reasons;

First, I was never asked what kind of vacation I’d like to go on and my wife kind of signed me up for this. My wife and I have gone on vacations to the beach with her family before and I haven’t enjoyed myself any of those times, although this time we would be going with completely different people. I personally enjoy relaxing rather than finding a bunch of activities to do and going to tons of restaurants. I don’t want to be dragged around to different activities and restaurants that I have no interest in. I have told her before that I won’t go on any more family vacations due to bad experiences.

Second, we live in Ohio and this is easily an 11+ hour drive to North Carolina. My wife doesn’t like to drive in places that she’s unfamiliar with so I would be driving the entire time. When she’s in high traffic areas she has panic attacks and gets scared. I’ve told her this and she insists that she would drive but in the end I will be the one driving because she doesn’t like to. I have drive to ocean city with her for two previous family vacations and our trip has ended up being around 12 hours and it’s a rough drive. I could barely keep my eyes open and was pounding energy drinks to stay awake.

Third, If my wife and I go then two more people would need to be added to the group to make the reservations $600 a person. So, this means that my wife and I would be paying $1200 (possibly more if someone backs out) just for a place to stay, not including any other expenses related to the vacation. In my opinion we would need around $2,000 total to have a comfortable vacation. We could swing this and it wouldn’t be the dealbreaker but it’s a lot of money.

When my wife showed me the listing I told her that I would look it over and think about it. She got upset and started crying and was in a bad mood the rest of the night.

I feel bad that she is upset but I was never involved in any vacation plans from the beginning. 

Am I the asshole?

**Edit:** Well guys, it looks like I’m heading to NC next year. We had a discussion (more like a fight but whatever) and figured things out. There’s no way that I was going to let my wife drive with our 1 year old down to NC by herself. She also said that she’s willing to get a hotel halfway there and back so I don’t have to make the entire drive at once. We’ve agreed to both save up and that we won’t be doing *every* activity with the group. We can go out to dinner a couple times, spend time to ourselves and relax. There are some places I’d like to maybe see because I went to NC as a kid and it would be fun to revisit them.

I think both of us overreacted. She promises to include me on future vacation from now on. I also told her what an ideal vacation would be for me, and that we can try to do that next year. She said this trip to NC doesn’t have to be an every year thing.",0,Male,original
I am (25f) my boyfrined (26m). I think this info is important so here. When I post pictures or videos I usaully stand and pose certain ways to make my body look good. I also put a filter usaully a color one on them. We also go on eachothers phones and know the passwords to them. We were at the beach and he was on my phone. I was sitting and reading a book I knew he was on it but I didnt know what he was doing. He was taking pictures of me and a video of me too. He posted them on my social media and never told me. We were back at the house and I had my phone back and I saw the notifications. They were from likes and comments. I did not know it was from that until I looked. I was shocked and started to get really nervous and looked at them. I dont think I looked good in those. My face looks mean and I didnt know he was filming me so I had it like that. My body also looked really long in it idk what he did. I sort of freaked out and was saying why would he do this when he knows I do all that stuff. He says I looked beautiful and didnt see the problem. I was really nervous (ik it is a bot dramatic) and sort of hyperventilating because I was worried who had all seen it. I deleted it and told my boyfriend its whatever now. He tried to say sorry but I was reslly mad because he knows I hate looking bad in stuff. I know this might seem stupid but do you think I am the ahole.,0,Female,original
"I (f19) have a boyfriend (m27) that I've been dating for 5 months, we are long distance and it puts strain on the relationship. I like to call him all the time, but I plan it and make sure to stick to the plan. (I'm fine with plans being ruined if there's an emergency or family problem.) 

I asked my boyfriend on the 8th if we could talk on the 11th for a while, I had a tough week starting school again and missed him a lot. (Since we are both busy during the day, every 11th he spends some time with me since that's the day of the month we first started dating. It's important to me we at least spend some time together, so I always make sure I don't make plans.

He normally abides by this which I am grateful for. The call was set to start around 10:30 and he had been playing/watching his friend play video games all day which I was fine with, because he promised me the call. Amid my excitement and anticipation I received a text around 10 from him saying that the game ending was coming up so they were just going to keep playing and he'd call me when he got a chance. I was understandably disappointed by that but I figured I could wait a little while and then have my time. 

He told me it would be around 3 hours. I was very unhappy, because I had school. I couldn't stay up until 1 am just to wait and talk to him for 10 minutes. I told him that I was not happy with that and he told me that it was ""a situation I don't have control over."" I asked him if he could stop, which was then when I was told that seeing his friend's reaction to the ending of a video game was ""super important"" and ""a once in a lifetime opportunity."" 

He almost dumped me because he couldn't handle that I was upset when he was ""clearly in the right"". I wound up staying up for him anyways to talk to him and clear it up. It was not only a time that I specifically requested to have with him, but also on a day that meant so much to me. I spent those three hours crying all alone just wondering if I really was valued less than a videogame. 

If he had told me a few hours in advance maybe I would have made plans around it. He told me that he was looking forward to the ending for a long while now and that he didn't just want to ask his friend to stop playing and resume later, which is understandable. 

The fact that hurts me the most when I think about it is that every time it gets brought up he says ""it wasn't in my control"" which yes, timing wasn't in his control, but he acts like the whole situation couldn't have been helped and that it was 100% out of his control, like he was forced to stay and watch. 

I tried not to hold it over his head that he did something that made me really upset. He promised it was a 1 time situation, however I can't help but trust him less over this and feel like I'm worth less than a videogame. He still gets mad at me for holding my ground and not taking his side.

I just want to know if I should be worried about what he did or if I'm overreacting and should apologize. AITA?",0,Female,original
"Ok, I know this sounds trivial but I am a little bit upset and don’t know if I should be apologizing or standing my ground. My 37M boyfriend just moved in with me (24F). Things have been going OK aside from the occasional bickering.

He has a ton of clothes. When he moved in, he moved everything in with garbage bags and laundry baskets. The last 2 weeks or so I had spent hours doing his laundry, folding, hanging stuff up. I just can’t keep up. There’s too much and it’s too unorganized. I have one washer and one dryer. He will leave clothes in the dryer for days (not sure if he expects me to fold them or what). Well I had to wash my clothes. They had been in the wash maybe 15 hours and clothes get a weird smell if they sit too long. I work during the day, so I didn’t really have time to fold my boyfriends laundry; I just moved the clothes from the dryer to the bed so I could put my clothes in the dryer. 

He lost it on me and said you can’t fold clothes when they’re cold, as in not fresh out of the dryer and that I wasn’t doing him any favors moving it and that he’d never do that to me. Basically said he would have to rewash everything (not sure why). Well of course he’d never do that to me because I remove my clothes once they’re done but that’s beside the point.  

AITA for taking his clothes out of the dryer and not folding them? I feel like I might be. On the other hand, I work full time and do most of the cleaning and cooking and I feel it’s not fair he just expected me to fold all his clothes or just wait however many days it would take him to do it before doing my own laundry.",0,Female,original
"I think my boyfriend is codependent because his last relationship was very abusive with a narcissist, emotionally unstable woman who he financially supported for years. They recently spilt before we met. He bends over backwards for people and sees it as his lot in life to take care of others, which is wonderful and kind, but I'm scared he's going to be taking advantage of.

His narc ex invited a couple to live for next to nothing on their property in an RV. The couple still lives there even though the ex is gone. They are young, guy doesn't work and girl is only employed part time, she is always in the house using the kitchen. She comes and goes from the house as she pleases.

I tried to make friends with her when I first started spending more time at the house because she seemed cool. Quickly I came to realize she is someone who is very emotional, no boundaries and causes drama. She is exhausting to have around and I'm beginning to feel like they are using my boyfriend. They are basically living there for free. When I asked my boyfriend about it, he says he feels protective of the girl and doesn't want to turn her out homeless. I understand that, but they have the RV, and I think she has options of she looks for them. I think he's being used and enabling their lifestyle because he's not asking them to pay rent.

To add, his dog is terrified of them and freaks out whenever they come in the house, even though they've lived there almost 2 years. In contrast, his dog loves me and doesn't bark even when I'm at the door, and has never growled or snapped at me. We play and cuddle all the time. I trust the dog's instincts but my boyfriend says he thinks his dog is just neurotic for no reason. To me, it sounds like maybe the couple is using his house when he's not home.

"(not a throwaway account, i just normally only use reddit to browse and read things)

I’m on mobile and absolutely reeling, so apologies for any formatting or grammar errors. For context we are both about 20, and we’re lesbians.

Me and my partner are polyamorous, under the agreement that we acquire the others consent before entering any other partnership. We do not share partners, and are each other’s “anchor” couple, with plans for moving in together and marrying and having children. We are long distance, but only about 10 hours drive, so we see each other about bimonthly. 

Last year, I was the first to ask about dating another person, my close friend who goes to college with me. My partner said yes, but seemed uncomfortable. I asked her if she was actually okay with it, and she said no, not until she moves in with me, so I have respected that to this day and continue a completely platonic friendship to this day. 

Recently, she expressed to me that she had feelings for one of her friends. I wanted to be petty and say no, because it felt hypocritical, but I understood my reasoning was petty, and I love my partner. I want her to be happy more than I want to be a dick about being perfectly fair, because I dont feel fairness and keeping score is good for a relationship. I told her yes, and tried to get to know the person as a friend (at my girlfriends request). I meant the yes. I take no issue with this scenario, it’s just context. 

Skip to tonight. I go in our friend group chat and she’s made a cute, flirty powerpoint asking a friend out who I know of vaguely, but she hasn’t brought them up to me recently, and never mentioned having feelings or wanting to pursue them. I found out by reading the presentation. It hurt, I’m not gonna lie. I texted her, and asked a few questions, and told her I was angry. I didnt name-call or threaten to leave, just made sure she was aware I was not okay with this. But it slowly started to sink in, I considered this cheating. I know it’s dubious and grey area, but to me I felt used and cheated on as a “safety net” or “base”, since I’m the financial breadwinner and pay for everything we do. So I told her that what she did was cheat, and I needed some space. She’s texting me constantly, and she’s told other people she’s going to harm herself. I feel so guilty ignoring her, but I just cant deal with sorting this out right now. So I’m just ignoring her (dick move, I know, but it’s been 1-2 hours at most since I found out). Am I the asshole for leaving her to her own devices when she’s in a bad place mentally and saying she cheated when the situation was a little grey? Am I going too far :(?",0,Female,original
"Not sure if this is necessary, but TW for eating disorder.


I (31F) was looking through an old set of photos with my bf (37M) when a picture of me from 5ish years ago came up. He told me I looked really good in the picture. I let him know that during that time period I was struggling with an eating disorder and literally not eating.  He said again, ""well, you look really good."" I told him again that I wasn't eating during that time and that I don't really care if I looked good because I was being super unhealthy and it wasn't safe. Basically that I'll never look like that again because I'm never going to stop eating like that again. Again he tells me, ""well, you looked really good. Just accept the compliment.""

That's when I get defensive and snapped a bit. I said that's really fucked up that you keep telling me how good I looked in that picture when I'm explaining to you that it's only because I WAS NOT EATING. He doubled down so I said a couple times ""that's fucked up dude"" in kind of an agressive tone.  

He snapped back and told me that he didn't want to be attacked like that for giving me a compliment and that I should just accept the compliment. He said he wouldn't be able to keep dating me if I was gonna attack him and snap on him like that, especially when he was just trying to compliment me. So I apologized and tried to walk it back.

Bit of context, my bf is attracted to me now without a doubt. I'm healthy and happy and he's always going on about how much he likes my body and stuff and we have a healthy sex life. This old picture wasn't wildly different from how I look now, maybe 10 lbs less and much tanner. It just rubbed me the wrong way how he wanted to double down on my appearance instead of showing empathy for what I was going through. 

I realize I could have been calmer about it and explained my feelings better before jumping straight to being defensive and angry.

"Look man, to each their own if you wanna spend your time learning tiktok dances and trends to post them then by all means do you, just don’t force me to partake in that with you. I already let her take reaction videos of me and her pranks which isn’t really a problem but mainly because she’s not asking me to do anything. Just getting reactions that happen in the moment. I feel like she wants to be like one of those tiktok couples seeing that she’s always following and searching pages like that. Personally, I’m not very fond of watching random self absorbed teenagers who like looking at themselves make unfunny videos and in no way wish to partake in any of those trends. As you might be able to tell from what I’ve said so far, clearly tiktoks annoy me (the videos that are trends and not simple cool vids at least). I know my gf wants to do that type of stuff with her makeup and all and I’ve assured her I would never knock her for it, I felt that today she was being completely irrational. Earlier, my gf proposed I do a tiktok with her where I do a dance. Smiling and lightheartedly I said “fuck no! You know I don’t like doing tiktoks babe please don’t get make me do it” long story short we got into a little dispute over it and she’s pretty upset at the moment. She ended it with “fine you don’t have to be in any of my tiktoks at all.” That one really upset me because why did me not wanting to do a tiktok dance translate to me not being in any at all. After a few minutes of explaining why I didn’t feel that was an appropriate answer and seeing she’s not getting it I kinda just tuned out and stopped talking to avoid escalation since I was getting progressively more and more irritable. I plan on apologizing later for having such a repulsive action with the “fuck no” cause she claims I was rude about it, but besides that I really don’t think I’m being an ass hole to the point that’s worth her being genuinely upset with me. Am I the ass hole?I really don’t think I should feel like avoiding her attitude is the only good reason to do those little dances with her when I really don’t want to do them to begin with. I also think it’s worth pointing out that to try and compromise I said I’ll do the dance with her and record it and all so long as she doesn’t post it",0,Male,original
"So my S.O.’s mom is sick and I’ve offered to help with keeping her house clean since she’s supposed to be resting, which is what I’ve been doing. Today, I offered to go through the fridge and throw out old food to make room for new groceries and food that her mom (my S.O.’s grandma) brings to her. 

It was a god awful mess in there. At least half of the non-liquid items were either mouldy or straight-up rotting in their containers, and I ended up having to throw out about 10lbs of old food. Some of the food had expired MONTHS ago, and the smell of the decaying food alone was enough to make me want to vomit. 

I disposed of the food and went to my S.O.‘s room to take a quick snooze, since I have a habit of taking short naps to deal with stress (and I wanted to stop smelling that godawful smell of rotting food since I was borderline dry heaving when in the kitchen) I had left the dishes/containers the food was in in the sink, and I’d submerged them in soap water and was planning to give them a more thorough cleaning when I woke up.

Unfortunately, when I was sleeping, my S.O.’s mom went downstairs and saw the sink of dishes. She’s kind of a neat freak so she got upset at my S.O. and I and didn’t even thank us for cleaning out the fridge. I tried explaining the situation and she completely ignored me. So now I’m wondering if I should’ve just sucked it up and dealt with the dishes right then and there. 

TL;DR I offered to help clean old food from the fridge because my S.O.‘s mom is sick. There were 10lbs of mouldy/rotting food that I had to toss, and I took a break because if I stayed around the smell for any longer then I would’ve puked. My S.O.’s mom saw the food containers (during said break) I was going to wash later soaking in the sink and got mad that my S.O. and I didn’t finish the cleaning job in one go, despite me telling her about how the mouldy food almost made me puke. AITA?

EDIT: I see some people asking how she can be a neat freak with a fridge full of decaying food. She has this “not my problem if I can’t see it” mentality. For instance, she can’t see inside the oven, so she ignored the grease pool at the bottom of it, but if my S.O. leaves homework papers on the dining table where she can see it when she walks by, she’ll get upset and tell him to clean it up.",0,Female,original

Going to try and make this as short as possible. Essentially I’ve been having some trouble at work and an unknown issue has gone to HR. I’m a physician so this is a big deal to me. My boss claims not to know what the issue is and says that he’s trying to figure out which complaint went to HR. He said he sent a bunch of emails today to find out the root cause of the problem. I have no idea what the issue is and it’s been causing me a lot of anxiety. I can’t even fathom. So today while I was at work I stayed very much so to myself haven’t texted anybody and have been focusing on just getting my work done and getting out of there. I rounded with my patients, spoke to case managers, updated families and finished my notes. I text my boyfriend this afternoon saying “I am so stressed out and depressed, I can’t today.” He responds back saying “ Why??? Wtf is going on with you 
And if your so depressed I find it weird you haven’t even wanted to talk to me all day about it. Like who are you venting to???” I felt like that was such an inappropriate response to the statement I had made and I got really upset and told him “you need to stop making everything about you I’ve been really stressed out I’ve just been trying to get my work done and get out of here. I spent all night talking to you about it, what more am I going to vent about when I don’t know what’s going on?!” And sent him a screenshot of my outgoing messages which were all to hospital staff/nurses/other doctors. Hee responded “wow you’re so condescending. you totally missed the mark. It’s fine” This seems like kind of a pattern with him I’ve decided to find a new job and I can tell from the tone of his messages in our conversations that he’s not very happy about me possibly having a new schedule again about him because our schedules will no longer coincide if and this is a big if I took a new job and it’s not even necessarily that our schedules would not overlap it’s very possible that they still could overlap depending on where I choose to work and what schedules I choose to work.

I am a 21(F) with a partner a year younger than me in college. I know they have a hard home life with an incredibly strict grandmother who makes them feel awful all the time.

I told my s/o this and the most my partner ever said was that they were sorry and they wish they could help.

"Hey everyone. I am 26(m) and I recently broke up with my girlfriend, Lisa,  of two years. Lisa had approached me telling me she wasn’t happy in the relationship and wanted to work on it more, but nothing I ever did seemed good enough, and it began to feel like I was “working” all the time. On top of that she was flirting with a classmate a lot which made me feel uncomfortable tbh. 

The issue is, Lisa is in her last semester of college and broke. She doesn’t work, her family is unable to help, and the school she attends is already having a housing issue, so they can’t help until the next semester which is in late January. Two weeks ago I gave her the thirty days notice required and she blew up. 

She thinks she can live on campus next semester, but asks that i allow her to have the extra room, but I really don’t want that. The relationship is over and I no longer feel responsible for her, but if she moves out she will have to withdraw from her classes which will push her graduation back and she would lose all of the money paid.

"I always do the laundry, but last week I didn’t wash any of his uniforms. But I did wash everything in our hamper. So if they were in the hamper they would have gotten washed. But they weren’t. 


I leave earlier than him, so I got ready, made him some oatmeal, let it cool (so he could eat at as soon as he woke up) - while I made up his lunch and stuck it in the fridge. Left his Aderall out for him. woke him up, and left.


He texted me wondering where his uniforms were. I said I didn’t know. He then called me wondering why they hadn’t been washed. I said I washed everything in the basket. He got all upset and said I was being passive aggressive but not doing it to, “send a message”. But I genuinely didn’t wash them originally because they weren’t in the basket.


Now - truth be told, after I had washed our clothes - I did find it odd that they weren’t in there. And found them in a corner in our closet. There’s 2. But he has 1 good one. I admittedly left it there. And I do feel bad. It was dusty. But I personally believe he could’ve worn them if he really wanted to. But he instead called in. And then blew up at me when I got home. 


This was last weekend. And he got mad on Monday. But I didn’t post it cause it was the week and I was a little busy. So I just waited til the weekend.

D was having some beers and playing XBOX (it's worth noting here, when he plays he's on with our mutual friend and has headphones on, his voice is obviously still audible to myself/kids especially after a couple beers when he thinks he's more quiet than he actually is) and at about 10 when K laid down I asked him to keep it down so K could sleep. Shortly after, I got J down and asked D to PLEASE be quiet because the boys were both in bed and I was trying to go to sleep myself. 1am rolls around and I've been asking every half hour for him to keep it down (something he kept complaining to our friend about but like...do it and I wouldn't keep asking?), he's woken K up several times and I've yet to fall asleep at all so I'm coming across pretty btchy at this point. I got up and moved the ear piece so he could hear and told D he was ""being a selfish ass and a shitty husband and father"" and he just looked at me before shutting everything down and getting in bed without saying anything.

I feel like I may be TA because he rarely has downtime from work and he is currently stressed because of the new position he'll be a part of so I understand him playing is an attempt to destress as well as ""hang out"" with our friend who lives in our home state, plus I think I genuinely hurt him by saying what I said. I'm not one to insult him, he's a wonderful partner who is great with our boys, but I still said what I said to him and it felt true in regards to the moment/situation.",0,Female,original
"My(29M) wife(25F) chews really loud. Like really really loud and she doesn't close her mouth while chewing either. 

I've tried not liking her in the face when we're eating together and also have tried using earplugs while eating but she gets madat me saying that it's rude to not look at her when she's talking and me wearing earplugs makes her feel like I don't like listening to what she has to say. 

I have OCD and it's really irritating for me when she chews so loud.... I also sleep in a different room because she's really messy in her room( she stores gooey chocolates in her bedside drawyer! And she leaves half eaten pizza under the bed)

So I started eating in my room. 

AITA?

Edit: It's started only after the birth of our daughter. Our daughter is 5 years old now and apparently my wife is tired from the ""baby care"" although she's not a SAHM and we both take equal care of our daughter. She says that she's too tired to actually care about the mess in her room. I do all the cleaning at home since it doesn't even bother her when the house is messy. She cooks all 3 meals. I do all the laundry because my wife is so messy that she doesn't even bother to wear fresh clothes...... She just does the sniff test and wears each dress about 3 times before a wash. She doesn't even clean the kitchen after she's done with cooking. 
I pick up and drop my daughter to school, brush her teeth and brush her hair while my wife does the rest of childcare like bathing, dressing, feeding etc.",0,Male,original
"My ex and I got together over 3 years ago, moved into my house after a year.

She has two children from a previous relationship. We also have a child together who is now almost a year old.

&#x200B;

We mutually decided to break up a few weeks ago. I have my reasons, and she has hers but ultimately her kids play a big role in the break up. Not their fault, its more about our different parenting styles. Due to my exes trauma from when she was a child and the kids bio father emotionally abused all 3 she had a protective bubble around them that was a massive source of conflict. I could write a list but I don't see how it would be beneficial to this.

&#x200B;

Anyways, we broke because we didn't want to resent each other for our child's sake. Like the way she resents her other kid's father. They have been staying here until she finds a new place. However, she keeps making remarks about how I'm going to struggle on my own, especially when I have my daughter half the time. I've left it be because I'm pretty sure she is projecting, she will no doubt struggle. But it is also the damn time. I was having a particulary bad day in work and she know and she brought up how I'm going to cope with work and our daughter.

&#x200B;

My life would be easier when they move out.

Yes, I will be having my daughter 3 nights/4 days a week, I changed my work pattern so when I do have her I don't have to work. So I have no issues there.

Looking after my daughter will be a breeze, I have no issues now looking after her. In fact I make sure I have her more than her mother because I love spending time with her. And it will be even easier when her and her kids move out for so many reasons. The biggest is that all 3 cannot help themselves and always have to disturb my daughter when she is trying to sleep, so she then doesn't sleep and gets cranky and whines until I take her to my mothers so I can put her to sleep in peace. All 3 are extremtly messy, my entire house is a minefield and it stresses me out to no end and none of them clean up after themselves. I also find myself doing more for her kids then she does, I always take them to school and pick them up, take them to their after school activities. Make sure they are fed and shower often as otherwise she wouldn't remember. I also pay for everything related to the house. We only split shopping and petrol.

&#x200B;

So I told her that when they move out I will have more money to save. Because I will be spending less on bills, and this is after me paying more than I should in child support. My house will be back to being clean and tidy, that will reduce my constant stress. Looking after my daughter will be less stressful because I will be able to put patterns in place to help. I will have more free time because I'm not spending it cleaning up all their mess, running around all day for her kids when it is her job.

My life will finally be back in my hands. She didn't take it too well and has been quiet ever since.",0,Male,original
"TLDR: Boyfriend caused a minor scene and threw up at my small birthday party. I asked about being aware to stop before getting to that point and was told I was being controlling. 

Ok, so here we go. My (F27) bf (M28) enjoys drinking when he is able to (he does not drink on weekdays/before work). He may have an occasionally beer on a Thursday, but for the most part, it’s a weekend thing. However, when there is an event (party, social gathering, etc) he tends to overdo it. I personally am not the biggest fan of alcohol (I will have a drink or two) so I normally will DD if anything. In part, I think part of the issue is that a lot of his friends egg him to keep drinking (ultimately it is his choice though) and it’s just led to headaches for me. He has left the gas grill outside on one for hours (I found it by chance because I brought my dog out), he is very clumsy and falls on me, or he just gets very loud and confrontational. 

The main incident: I was having a small group (six people including my bf and I) over for my birthday party. The week of my party, my bf got a new job and was super happy. We were at a day drink party earlier in the day (we were invited to this AFTER I had planned my party but I wanted him to be able to see his friends as well). 

Nothing eventful happened, but we left and went back to set up for my party. I guess I didn’t account for his earlier drinks, but he got VERY drunk. He threw a plastic coke bottle on the ground and was acting like a child and wouldn’t pick it up. We ended up also having an argument about the amount of movies we have seen in a trilogy (it turns out I was wrong and did apologize the day after). Ultimately, he disappeared and my friends were asking where he was. I went to the bedroom and saw he was passed out on the bed. I went back to sit with my friends and as it got late, some people left. I was in the bathroom when I heard him throwing up. I went to the bedroom and saw he threw up all over himself and on my side of the bed. I was frustrated, but just had him strip and dealt with it on my own. I still had friends over and honestly, it was very embarrassing to have to deal with this in front of them. 

The next morning I asked my bf what he remembered. He didn’t even remember throwing up on himself. I brought up his behavior and such and his defense was that he wanted to celebrate his new job. I said how I’m proud of his new job, but this was supposed to be something for me and I had to end up taking care of him. I suggested that in the future, we stop drinking when we reach our limit and he responded that I was being controlling. So, Reddit, AITA for being controlling?",0,Female,original
"Hello reddit, my daughter is 2 weeks old. I have barely held her since she was born. My wife constantly has her. When I do get to hold her, my wife just starts crying hysterically until I give her back. I asked her why and she said she was anxious that something would happen to our daughter and that's why she felt the need to hold her so close. 

No matter how much I tried to reassure her, she just wouldn't let up. I practically begged her just to let me hold her so that my wife could shower, eat, and care for herself but nothing worked. I felt like I was losing precious bonding time with my daughter so I did what I thought I had to do. My wife fell asleep on the sofa with our child, I took her, went to the guest bedroom and locked the door. 

My wife woke up shortly after, very upset of course that our daughter wasn't with her. She soon realized I was in the guest room and begged me to open the door. She was crying, kicking, and screaming. I didn't open it though, and spent a good couple hours with our daughter in there. 

Apparently my wife had called her mom, because I got a call from my mil cussing me out, saying how I shouldn't be taking a newborn from her postpartum mother and other things like that. My wife has been furious with me and won't speak and I'm just so frustrated because I really just wanted to spend quality time with my child but maybe that wasn't the way to do it.

"For context: My fiancé and I have been together for almost three years now and the brother has disowned him until this past January, and even then still doesn’t try to make time to see my fiancé much so they haven’t spent much time together. 

With our new working schedules, we haven’t gotten to be in a great place again due to lack of communication and time together. I work 12s on the days he gets home at 4 and every other weekend. It just happened that way when he got a new job. All in all we get maybe 4 days a month to have all day together and it’s spent with him working on homework for his job and me cleaning the house before it falls apart. A few days ago I had mentioned that I feel really alone and I would like to work on it. He asked me things he could do to work on our relationship and vice versus. Last night I came home and the bed had roses on it and a little gift and we were flirting and we called it part A to our little date. I did not sleep well at all (3 or 4 hrs all together) and had to work today. We had been really sweet on each other all day and he called me when I got off and told me to meet him at a restaurant for a part b date. We go in, sit down, and he had requested his brother as our server, not the biggest deal. But he stood there and talked for 10 minutes, after the brother had went to get our food, my fiancé asked me why I didn’t look like I was having a good time and I said that I hope we can have a little alone time. And we had a five whole minutes of it. His brother then sat at our table the rest of the date. And my fiancé said he was upset with me that I wasn’t able to go with the flow and make the best out of it. I said that it felt important to me and so of course I was a little heavy hearted because it was not the same for him. I didn’t expect them to not talk but I also didn’t think our entire date would become about him. I was told that dates don’t have rules and it was a last minute thing and not a big deal and I’m crazy and rude for not wanting him there. I wasn’t rude or mean but I definitely wasn’t present throughout it. I honestly feel so gaslit and broken hearted about it all. Was I wrong for not being more understanding?",0,Female,original
"Some back story. I live with my Fiance and two kids under 3. My fiance has to fight Bipolar disorder, and I try to support her as much as I can. She recently started working at the same company I work for, and we work the same hours..so we carpool. 

Anyhow, I've been noticing that she is Manic more often and just having mood swings rather normally. She has told me that I'm not allowed to ask about her medication, but I also noticed that she hasn't been needing a refill for longer than normal. Jump to last night, she admitted that she ""Hasn't been taking them as much as she needs to"". This morning she woke up in an absolutely terrible mood. I mean, talking down, short, demeaning. Something that I know would bring my mood down for the day. Once we got the kids dressed I said that I would like to take my own car to work. I wanted that time to decompress with myself. She told me that I wasn't taking my own car. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me. I told her that she doesn't make the decision, but if she would like to have a conversation about it, then we could talk. Her answer to that was ""If you take a different car, I'm quitting my job (She knows this urks me. I helped get her this job, and I put my name on the line when I did), and I'm sleeping somewhere else.

My F,29 husband M,33 recently got kicked out of his job and he decided to sue his former boss for misjudgement. He's been feeling upset eversince. He really worked hard to get his possession and seeing years of work go to waste was devastating for him.


His friends have been taking him out to cheer up and let off some steam. The problem is that he'd be gone for hours and show up late at night drunk.

He did it 2 times this week. He came home at 2am while drunk and made noise because he expected me to open the door for him when I was asleep. I couldn't wait for him and stay up late because unlike him I have work and other responsibilities. When he complained about how I should be quick to open the door for him I told him that next time he come home late like 2am and up then I won't be opening the door for him. Period. He said he won't stay out late again and that my ""challenge"" was accepted.


Last night he went out with his buddy who dropped him off outside at 2:30am. I was awake at the time when my husband kept ringing the bell then knocking on the door. I remained in bed and refused to open the door. He called my phone telling me he was outside and I needed to open up. I asked him to tell me what time it was and he said ""it's 7:30! It's still early come on open the door!"" It was obvious he was drunk. I said I won't open the door for him after I already warned him and told him I was going back to bed then hung up. He kept calling over and over then knocked several times on the door then he stopped. Turns out he slept in then garage on the floor. He had a huge argument with me calling me petty and ridiculous for keeping him out of his and refusing to open the door for him. I reminded him that I didn't have to stay up every week to wait for him and open the door for him. He said he forgot his key and that I was clearly trying to prove a point here but said that it's his house and I should never and under any circumstances keep him out of it like that. He told me to apologize and say I'll never do it again but I walked out the kitchen while he was talking which pissed him off more he then said he was going through rough times and I was making it worse and being unsupportive.",0,Female,original
"The grammar might be messy because I’m babysitting 3 of my wife’s nieces while watching my own newborn so I don’t have much time to correct anything. before anyone makes a comment my wife she deserves a night out with her sisters after everything.

So my wife(29f) is from Ireland and is catholic I’m (32m) originally from a christen conservative Texan household . I moved to Kerry a few years ago for a job and met my beautiful wife I not only fell in love with her but her amazing family 

When we got engaged she suggested we get married in America  so my brother who was dying of cancer at the time could attend. Our families got along till they found out her brothers/dad/uncle/grandfathers made a plan to us go on wild night out bringing my bother along. the day of the wedding like seriously I don’t walk sober up till a few days after the wedding 

The ended up hating my wife because she found it hilarious both her grandfathers where behind us going to multiple “clubs” and heavy drinking to the point our wedding was a stand up show with all the comments from her side.

We had a baby a few weeks ago and decided to have her christened I invited my family because I thought they could put everything in the past and love this amazing woman like I do. But no since they got here every thing is just “not right” I bit my lip on my wife’s advice because she wanted our daughter to always embrace her Irish and American family 

Well we thought everything was going smoothly for the christening till they found out her god parents would be my wife’s sister and her girlfriend. I wanna say her sister and her girlfriend have been amazing to both of us although the pregnancy/birth so who better could we pick? Out of everyone in this world we know if anything happened to us we’d want no one else to raise our child but them 

There was outrage and tantrums from my family to say the least my wife was called every name other than a lady (I can give details in the comments) so I told my family (parents,sister,grandmother) that if they can’t be decent people for a day for my child’s sake they weren’t invited. The Christening took place and my mil said she saw my mother crying outside the chapel,
she told me they had come along way for my sake  I could have at least given them a second chance and let them attend.

"Sorry for my bad English. 

The incident happened last Sunday and we have barely spoken since.

I am 26 and my boyfriend is 29 years old if that matters. 

So his parents gifted us both a visit to the climbing forest 2 hours away. It was supposed to be a nice Sunday but bf was in a bad mood the whole day. I asked him what was wrong, he said I was 5 minutes late (we didn't have any pressure regarding the time), so I guess he was just in a bad mood without a reason. 

So the day was quite fun, we made the parcours together and are doing good. When we made a break to drink some water bf took his phone with, which is strictly forbidden in the climbing forest. 

I told him I don't want him to do that but he did it anyway. I also told him I don't want any trouble here since I wanna have one nice day apart from learning for a scary exam I have in a week. I also told him to not make pictures of me. I don't want pictures there. He tends to secretly take pictures of me in special moments which I utterly dislike. And we talked about that topic before, he knows I don't like it.

Just to make clear: I like taking pictures and we take pictures a lot, I just don't want pictures taken without my knowing.

So we did the last parcour which was the toughest one. I was behind due to one obstacle I haven't managed right then. Bf was a couple platforms before me, which were going in a corner. From there he took a (assuming) video of me trying to manage this obstacle. I was trying like 10 minutes when I noticed him. I shouted to him to stop. He laughed and kept filming. I shouted an 'Are you dumb? ' to him, then I noticed there was a lady in the platform under him and I didn't want the lady to think I meant her (we chatted casually before). So I shouted 'Bf is filming me and isn't stopping!'. They were both like ten meters away from me, so I needed to shout to speak to them, but also not to far for him to take a video, he got the latest Iphone from his work.

Then an employee noticed us. He shouted to my boyfriend that he is not allowed to finish the parcour and he is expelled from the climbing forest (which was not thaaaaat bad, because the parcour was our last and there were only a few more platforms left). The employee also asked me if I had a phone with me, I said no. Bf climbed down to the ground and waited for me. I finished the parcour, which was nice. Then we went back to the car and drove home without talking. When we arrived to the house I live in I asked him if he wanted money for the fuel and if he wanted to come up to my flat. He said I broke his trust today and he needs time. I didn't say anything after that.

I don't think I am in the wrong but he haven't really spoken to me since. So AITA?


UPDATE:

Thank you so much for commenting. I really appreciated that. Nobody asked for an update, but I will do it anyway:

Since the incident we barely talked. A friend of mine told that last friday he RSVP'd no to her party which is in than two weeks. I assume he already made his decision then. Today we talked via phone because I insist of a mediator and not going alone to him. He didn't want that.

So he told me that since this day he couldn't trust me and therefore we don't match, so he wanna break up. No sorry. He said he didn't know I didnt want to make pictures and that I should have endured that and later should have told him to delete this pics (and it were pics according to him). He also said I talked to the employee when I actually talked to the lady under him. I told him that even i snitched he already knew I didn't wanna have pictures, so what's the matter?

Anyway, since this day nothing is like before. I personally think there is someone in his mind or someone put a bee in his bonnet. I don't understand anything he said. My friend and her boyfriend will take my stuff from him. I insisted they to it together so it will be OK. And I good of mine comes soon with ice cream.

To sum up, I guess when he took pictures of me and i said I didnt it and he took it anyway (yeah, that happened a lot) he always thought I was OK with it, since I didn't oppose it. I need to be more mindful of that one I guess. More adamant of what I want.",0,Female,original
"So last night my (17f) girlfriend was violently sick with some sort of stomach bug. She hadn't eaten all day because she couldn't keep any food down at all and on top of this she had just started her period which didn't help with the pain.

After not eating all day she couldn't go to bed as now her stomach hurt from hunger as well as period pains and the illness. She was crying from the pain (not something she does often as she's not a very sensitive girl) so i knew it was bad. I suggested she eat something slowly to avoid throwing it back up and to help with at least one of her pains. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later it all came back up while she was sleeping. She managed to sit up but wasn't fast enough to get to the bucket to the side of the bed and so it went on the sheets. No big deal as we could just change them and go back to bed. 

The spare sheets were in the airing cupboard just along the landing. Bare in mind this house was built in 1950s and not much had been done to it since so a lot of the floor boards under the carpet were loose. If you stepped on it it would make a loud creaking noise so being stealthy wasn't exactly an option at 4am.

Now here's where the problem comes, over the last few years her mother has become a heavy drinker and smoker, not being able to go to bed without having at least 3 cans and when she isn't working will start drinking at around 1pm. She works at a Lidl and chooses to work night/early shifts as she ""hates customers"" and so she will get up around 3am to then go to work at 6am. Bare in mind the store offers totally flexible hours so she doesn't have to work as early as she does. 

She constantly complains about how early she gets up and likes to bring it up in every argument she has. I cant ever tell her what I think of her as I'm paying rent and she likes to use it against me.

At the time I didn't know I had woken her up as she never says anything until its too late to fix. 

Later that day she gets drunk again after work and started shouting that we woke her up. i explained that I'm sorry for waking her up but I'm not sleeping in a bed full of sick. To this she replies ""its not good enough you woke me up and I have to get up early for work""; totally disregarding that her daughter is sick and that we had no other choice and she continues arguing about it and starts slamming doors.

In my opinion this is completely selfish and arrogant behaviour and not to mention quite childish for a 45 year old woman, but then again im living under her roof (paying rent of course) and should abide by her rules and cater for all her needs as she is the main provider of the household.

" My husband is great. And I love many many things about him. But I don’t love all the d-jokes he makes.. We were at my sisters and her fiancé’s apartment meeting him for the first time.

"*AITA for telling my ex that I didn’t wanna do things with HIS mother?* (Had to edit title) 

My ex fiancé (40M) and I (30F)were looking for an apartment. We went to see one that honestly, I didn’t like so I told him that we should keep looking. He tried to convince me to get that apartment and after a few days of thinking, I agreed. I even imagined how everything would look like and by the end of the week I was very happy with the apartment. The landlord texted him and asked him if we wanted the apartment. He said to me that he should ask his mom and if she said yes, if was a divine intervention and the confirmation that we should do it. 

I had to ask why he needed to have his mother’s permission to get the apartment even though I already had agreed to go for it AFTER he begged me to do it? Like why did he have to ask her if he was going to be living with me, not her? And most importantly, why my opinion didn’t matter? Like, if she says yes we take it, if she says no, we keep looking and I don’t have any saying. I felt so disrespected.

Then one day I was going to the spa and I told him that I wanted to go with him. He was happy about it and suddenly asked me if I would go to the spa with his mother? I said yes, just not every time. He got pissed! And the same thing happened when I told him that I wanted to go to a museum and we should go on a road trip since the museum was in another town. He said “yeah, let’s take my mom” and I was like ??? WHY DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE HER IN EVERY PLAN? 

Don’t get me wrong, I had a good relationship with her but I wanted to spend time just with him, in our newlyweds phase.  I told him that I didn’t want to include her in everything we do and ofc it was a huge argument and he got really mad.

Growing up was rough for my gf/fiancee. Before we started dating I was in the Army and saved everything I gained and placed it into income streams.When my fiancee and I started dating I was still kind of scraping by in life unaware of my investment's rising and we moved in together after 8 months together and a little later accidentally had a son. Now the issue, its been several years later now and money has gotten better but we still keep our finances separate while maintaining most of our life decisions with each other's say in the matter. I had some HUGE major winfalls in my life in the span of 4 years through investments and my landscaping side work was good even through 2020.I been wanting to make some power moves to improve our lives but it been a massive point of tension between us. One conflict is I been invest into the silver market and she's been not happy with me buying it up. She's been on my case thinking I'm being frivolous with my spending even though she's aware this isn't even a tiny dent on my money. Another point of tension is me and my bestfriend have been discussing realestate investment work for housing but she's been trying to convince me hold back and put it into savings. One of our biggest arguments was I Invested 60k to a buddy of mine to fund his mining operation and development projects. When she found out about it listening to me and my lawyer drawing up the contract in the living room she was furious. She accused me of just risking everything in our future with out even talking to her or not giving a damn about our future as well if just suddenly goes up in flames, which spurred an argument over my money. I feel like a jerk when I snapped at her telling her it didn't matter because it was my money I'm putting in and we have quite a few back up sources of income incase things went south. Another fall out we had was when I was trying to invest into my first rental property too. I don't really want to talk to her about it because it is my money in the end and my risk I don't want her to take the fall for Incase I screw up. She thinks I'm leaving her out because I don't want to have a life with her which isn't the case at all. I want to give my son and her a good life. Things get tense when the idea of money is brought up and shes been passive agressive over it. If I asked what she wants for dinner she tells me I can decided for my self. I've tried to ease her abit by having a joint account she can access but it doesn't seem to help Abit . I don't feel like I'm wrong cause I'm trying to do this with our future lives in mind however this has had our friends and some family members on both sides divided with some saying it is my money and others saying I'm a jerk because it would be a nasty surprise of anything were to go wrong and her say should matter too in my personal investments. Even my lawyer is split and all he can say is that at least the two of us are not married.",1,Male,original
"          So my boyfriend and I are two gay men (for whatever that's worth 🤷). My bf has a habit of springing the fact that he's going to see his friends, let's call them Tim and Tom. Tim and Tom live about 5 minutes down the road from us. And they're great people, I have no problems with them. However, everytime he wants to see them he goes to their house, which is fine. Problem is Tim and Tom drink a lot. So my bf almost always needs a designated driver. I have no issue being the DD either. My issue is that everytime he goes over there it's a weekday, and I work 9-5 Mon-Fri and I am not a morning person at all. I need my sleep. But the problem is not that he goes to see his friends, he could stay out till 2am and I wouldn't bat an eye. Seriously I'm not the guy who gets mad if my bf wants to spend a night out a few times a week, in fact I enjoy my alone time. 
            My problem is he'll go over to Tim and Tom's and tell me last minute. Then he asks me for a ride. Both of which are okay with me. But what's not okay, is I'll call him and ask ""Are you ready to come home? Or do you want to stay out later?"" Either is fine. But he'll say he wants to come home. So I say ""Okay I'll be there to pick you up in 5-10 minutes."" Once I get there I'll call him and tell him to come to the car to go. But almost every time I call him from the driveway he insists I come in for a drink. Often I tell him that I don't want to, or that I'm tired and want to go home to get some rest, or that I don't want to hang out and I came to specifically pick him up and go home. But he insists and keeps pushing, and I don't want Tim and Tom to think I don't like them and Idk if I'm on speaker or if they can hear me. So I go inside and without fail it turns into a 2-3 hour hang out session. He ignores all of my signals and gestures that it's time to go and I'm kind if sick of it. 
           I don't mind hanging out if it's planned a day or even a few hours in advance. And I don't care how long he hangs out with his friends. But it's annoying being ambushed into hanging out for 2 or more hours and then I also get the pleasure of having to remain sober while they all drink. So would I be the asshole if I told him I'm not going to be his DD anymore?
           Also I've spoken to him about this more than once.",0,Male,original
"Hi guys,

So, I (Male, 20 years old) went to the post office to pay my visa fees. At the time, I was wearing sport short, and normal T-Shirt and a flip flop. After finishing my stuffs with the post office, my girlfriend (also 20 years old) texted me and asked me to pick her up at her house. I said yes and I would be there. When I arrived, I texted her and waited outside to say that I was there. Then, she told me to come in, but when I came in, she immediately said my clothes weren't polite and she said that her dad didn't want to see my in short in his house and idk maybe jokingly said that I should go out to buy a pants then comeback inside. At that point I just didn't know what to say and it was really awkward because she said I wasn't polite for wearing that. Meanwhile whenevee I meet her dad, or her mom I always say hi with a big smile on my face. Her mom is friendly she smiles back. But her dad never says anything to me. However, things got more serious as she kept telling me to dress nicer when going out, even without her, I told her that the weather was very hot and my pants didn't fit me becauss I gained weight during the pandemic (73kg to 80kg) and that I would feel uncomfortable when I keep forcing my stomach in. I also told her that, it's alright because I didn't plan to go to her house anyways. But it leads into a fight about my politeness to her dad, that her dad didn't want to see that and my clothes wasn't polite enough. In overall, I just feel like I'm being disrespectful to someone without doing it and I feel like she is just trying to save her face because my clothes weren't polite enough...",0,Male,original
"Some background: Years ago I used to enjoy going away for the weekend and exploring new areas. Over the past handful of years that’s largely been put on hold because my bf won’t travel anywhere without the dog. His dog has had some health issues and he is too worried about him to spend the night away from him and he doesn’t have anyone he trusts to watch the dog beside me. So we can only do cabin trips and road trips in dog friendly areas. 
Recently, I’ve been in a rut. I’ve been working from home since Covid and have been feeling very secluded and burnt out. I have recently been saying I feel like I’m lacking some girl friends in my life. Then out of the blue, a friend from college invites me on a short girls trip! It was like the universe handed me what I asked for. 
My bf was super hurt and betrayed when I told him because he was under the impression that we were going to go to that specific location together one day in the future. He claims we discussed this and it was something he really wanted us to do together eventually since neither of us have been. I don’t remember this conversation- I do recall I begged to go there for one of my birthdays but he wouldn’t budge with his no traveling without the dog rule and said one day in the future we would go. I didn’t know that meant it was off limits in the meantime.  
He thinks it’s wrong of me to want to go and said it was a betrayal. I am hurt because I would support him 100% if he went on a boys trip regardless of location and I feel that it was blown out of proportion because a girls trip is completely different than a couples trip, even at the same location.",0,Female,original
"I’ve been selling online foot content since I was 18. I met my ex at 22, and was upfront and honest. He said that it wasn’t a deal breaker since I planned to stop after I got my Master’s degree.


Fast forward to 25, I get pregnant and we have a baby so I put finishing my degree on hold for a year. Then COVID hit a few months before I finish my degree, and he loses his job. I tell him that I think I should keep selling content until he can get another job, and then once we’re more stable I’ll get a career in my field. He agrees and admits he was going to ask but didn’t want me to feel pressured. Some months I make over $6k, so we have a huge savings and even manage to get a second car. He’s struggling to find a job but I’m making enough so it’s fine.


One of his friends subbed to me (I didn’t know who it was) and he became my biggest tipper. My ex finds out and deletes all my content off my computer and camera, and deleted all my profiles. I didn’t know and started freaking out, crying, trying to find numbers to call to restore them, etc, then he tells me he told a friend about my site and that friend has paid $2k+ in the last three months on me. We get into a huge fight because he’s still not working, and now I have to start all over again. We lose our second car after six months since now I’m lucky to make $3k. Our savings are gone because he keeps stealing from me. We end up fighting again and I leave him after he blames me for him deleting everything.


He runs and tells all his family that he found out I was a SWer and left me, and he needs their help to get our baby back. His family starts bombarding me, calling me names, and basically saying they’ll make it so someone as disgusting as me can’t ever see my baby again. After a few months of this, I just release screenshots dating back to 2018 of him talking about my ManyVids and other sites I used to sell on. His family FREAKS out, and now he’s disowned.


Personally, I think that it’s his fault. My family is aware of what I do and so are my friends. They respect that it’s work and have nothing to do with it. He told his friends, some of who he knows have hit on me, and deleted the way that I was keeping us clothed and fed when he couldn’t work out of jealousy, then told his family a lie that I could prove was false. But his friends and some mutuals think that I could have explained without being so blunt with the screenshots. I feel bad his family won’t speak to him because they feel used, but I don’t think it’s my fault.



Also, I literally sell feet stuff and the most I do is bra and panties. I could see him being jealous if I was doing traditional SW, but I wasn’t.

Edit: I just realized this might be relevant, but I never kept him from seeing our baby. He’s literally never contacted me or came to my new place (even though I let him know the address) to see either of us. He just immediately went to his family with his fake sob story. He also refused to sign the birth certificate AND refused a paternity test because he said he didn’t want to “be stuck paying child support”. I know I should have dipped then, but I was iN lOvE

Edit 2: You can totally DM me. I love helping because it’s so hard to start off, and I’m lucky to have a decade of knowledge to share

"I (F25, Asian) have been with my fiance (M27, White) for over a year now. His mom has been overbearing since day one, for example the first time I met her she asked me if I am “pleasing her son enough sexually” and wanted to know how many times/week I am making him finish. She also always calls him sexy and asks him to touch his arms or abs (which he doesn’t think is weird) but that’s a story for a different day. i just want readers to understand the kinds of things she says out loud. She has lately (the past two months) been more hostile toward me whenever we are around her saying that I am “getting in the way of her relationship with her son” and that I need to “let him be alone with her more.” My fiance tells her that he wants to spend time with me when he’s not working so she can either see both of us or neither of us. This last time we saw her, we were eating dinner at her house with her new husband and my fiances brothers when out of nowhere she said “I hope your children look only like their dad.” This was out of nowhere but that’s how she always is. I said, “well we aren’t going to be having kids anytime soon so you don’t need to worry about that” to which she replied “well I don’t want biracial grandkids because they’re always so ugly when features are mixed together like that.” Everyone got quiet and I didn’t even know what to say. Eventually she got up and offered everyone dessert. Soon after we left and in the car I expressed to my fiance that I was hurt by what she said and the fact that he didn’t stand up for me. He said he didn’t want to hurt her feelings and that she didn’t mean it to be hurtful. I told him that if we do have children that she will never be able to see them or be around them because I don’t want our future kids to be around someone like that. He’s mad at me now and keeps telling me that I need to see things from her perspective and that it’s unfair that I would put him in a position like that by not letting her see our kids one day. I told him that it doesn’t really matter right now but that I will not budge on this when the time comes.",0,Female,original
"I HATE being cold. I moved from the central US to the southern US to escape the cold. So my boyfriend (35m) and I (35f) went to a hotel with a rooftop pool and the pool is not heated. It's straight up cold. I jumped in up to my waist, but didn't get my back, arms, or neck wet because it's cold. My boyfriend isn't bothered by the temperature at all so he jumped in and completely submerged himself and went for a swim while I hung out in a little sunny spot at the edge of the pool. He came up and put his cold wet arm around me and I pushed him off and said it was too cold and he did it again so I pushed him off and again said he was too cold and I pointed out all the water spots on him and told him it was too cold which is why I didn't get in all the way. So he stood next to me for a while while we chatted and then he put his cold, wet hand on my back and I shoved his hand off and said to stop touching me because it was too cold and he got mad at me and said I embarrassed him and was being a bitch. He said I was being a bitch because his hand was the same temperature as the water. However, where he touched me was not wet. So AITA because I wanted him to stop touching me with his cold wet hands?",0,Female,original

"Hi guys. My boyfriend and I have been arguing a bit over some things recently. One of the things we argued about was him talking to his sister about our arguments that we have after an incident that happened a few months ago where she was talking to his ex wife and his ex used it against him in text message because she said she was going to use it in court. Since then we had agreed to keeping things to ourselves and most definitely not talking to her about it. (His sister) I didn’t care if she knew about the little petty arguments and have left it be when she had said he’s told her some things and I don’t mind telling her my side of the story, as long as it’s nothing serious. He told his sister that I’m “uncomfortable” with my body, that I won’t let him see me naked. We’ve been together for 2 years now and he has seen me naked before. I just don’t get dressed in front of him every time I gotta get dressed. I’m not saying he is wrong because I am uncomfortable with myself but that’s MY business. I got upset because he talked to his sister about it when it had NOTHING to do with any of the arguments we’ve had. I didn’t understand why he felt the need to tell her that ? It was my business and nobody else’s. I didn’t even tell my best friend that. I felt like it wasn’t his place to tell her that. But I apologized for getting upset about it, he ignored me and assumed I was trying to argue. But that was not my intentions. AITA for being upset about him telling her my business ?

"Using a throwaway and I’m on mobile, so I’m sorry for any formatting issues!

I (30F) asked and begged for a cat for over a year, but my partner (35M) kept saying he needed to get allergy tested first because he thinks he’s allergic. 

I didn’t want to bring an animal into the house that might make him miserable, so I just waited for him to get the testing done. 

Instead of getting the testing done, he got me a dog. A large, working dog. Sent a picture with the caption, “you have a puppy now!” I have depression and anxiety, and this dog has exacerbated both of them to the max. Bowser is sweet, but he’s huge, loud, and stronger than me. Instead of having a companion, I feel like I have another job.

At first I just sucked it up, and paid for everything for the dog. Vet visits, food, grooming, toys, etc. Worked on training him, dealt with the scratches, bruises, and mild destruction. But finally it all got to be overwhelming, and I said I would be happier, if we could rehome the dog. Normally, I wouldn’t  want to do such a thing, but I didn’t want the dog in the first place and he got it for me without asking. And the dog is expensive! I’m spending upwards of $500 a month. 

My partner loves the dog, and says Bowser makes him happy, so he doesn’t want to rehome him. I told him that was fine, but I wasn’t paying for any more of the dog’s expenses moving forward. He was ok with this at first, but now he’s kind of annoyed that I am not budgeting for the dog, or paying for anything. He keeps mentioning how expensive Bowser is, and pointing out things I’m spending my money on. 

Some of my friends have said I’m an AH for not saying something sooner, so what do you all think? AITA?",0,Female,original
"Context: There are hats that are exclusive and sold like a stock exchange. One person can buy a hat then sell it again for the price that they want to sell it for which means price can drastically change over time.

I made this account in 2011 where I had put birthday money into it (Over $400 at the time). I bought multiple hats and other gear that substantially grew to over $1500 in robux by 2018.

In 2018 I had gotten myself a girlfriend, (18yo female) (I was 17 yo male). Who’s sister was 10 at the time. So trying to be a good boyfriend I lended her my account. (She loves Roblox). I requested she not touch my belongings and she could play whatever she wanted.

Couple weeks later I see that she had sold a hat worth $600 and spent all of the $600 of robux onto one game giving her virtually nothing. 

As time went on the other gear I had remaining were still in my account and remain untouched. Which are still worth around $1300.

From 2018-2021 the little sister has put around $150-200 of birthday money over the years into the account.

2 weeks ago my girlfriend of 3 years has broken it off with me to pursue another person from her university. It was out of nowhere and somewhat shocking.

So with that being said, a week ago I took my account back in plans to sell the account with the remaining items because I am a 20 year old college student and could use the money. So I changed the password.

Not even an hour later my phone got blown up by not only my ex, but her parents as well demanding I give my account back because I was breaking a 13 year olds heart.

"My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been dating for about a year and a half. During that time he predominantly uses Snapchat as a form of communication, whether it’s with me or his friends. 

I usually put up with it, but he’s quite forgetful so snapchats deleting after 24h setting doesn’t help when he forgets he made plans with me, and I find it quite superficial and prefer text. He’s also quite a busy person with a lot of friends so my messages get lost in all his others and he doesn’t look through them for me so I’ll have to message him on multiple platforms sometimes to get a response, which makes me a little sad. 

I started using text, and let him know I’d like him to use it too. He’s been not reading my messages I sent him on there so let him know I’d like him to maybe pin me, I have him pinned, and that it would help him remember. I told him I like being able to look back on messages that make me smile and it’s a better platform for me. 

He flat out refused, said I should know “text annoys him” and says he’s not gonna do it. I let him know that I’m asking him to do it, that it would be nice for me if he could. He still refused. 

It’s such a dumb little thing, but am I not worth this dumb little thing? It’s something that would just make me feel a little bit loved, a priority, if you will (we’ve had many conversations about him not making me a priority in his life), but he can’t do it. This is honestly seeming like the last straw, if you know what I mean. 

So AITA?

"Background: my partner (M46) and I (F31) have been together for 8 years, and have been engaged now for 3, we had a big wedding planned pre-pandemic and understandably postponed it twice because of lockdown restrictions.

After the second postponement, my Father (M55) passed away suddenly and we postponed again because I was broken. My Dad's family fell out with us (me and sibling) when my dad died over funeral plans, inheritance issues - they basically wanted to ignore my Dad, my sibling, and my wishes and do what they want - so in terms of family, it is just me and my sibling now (mum passed in 2014).

My partner's family started hassling us about the wedding because restrictions are pretty much gone, everyone in our circle is vaxxed and can travel (partners family from another country). My partner and I paid for and will pay for everything, so it's not like his family have a financial stake here. I am really struggling with the idea of getting married without my Dad or my family there. When our Mum died, my brother and I both had severe depression, and our Dad (who just lost his wife) picked us up and carried us through (we were 22 and 24 at the time, so independent adults), I can't stress enough how incredible a man and Father my Dad was, and how shattering losing him so young has been. A big attraction to the wedding for me was dreams of him walking me down the aisle and making an embarrassing speech, I can't picture a big wedding without my Dad. My partner is completely fine with waiting so it's not an issue between us.

Future MIL and SIL were on Zoom with us and brought up the wedding again, looking for an update on when we were having it. I shrugged and said we weren't thinking about that just yet. SIL exploded and said it wasn't fair for me to hold my partner to ransom because of my ""daddy issues"" and that they deserved a wedding after spending so long in lockdown. Partner gently said he isn't being held to ransom and is fine with waiting, we've been together 8 years, a ring on the finger isn't a big deal. MIL said that if we didn't pick a date to hold the wedding next year in the next week, then she had no intention of coming, and SIL agreed. I removed myself from the situation and heard my partner arguing with them.

My partner and I decided to cancel the wedding, and we let everyone know by sending out cards. We lost a lot of money as most things had been paid for already. MIL and SIL are furious and not speaking to either of us. It wasn't worth it to us to have a wedding with none of my family, and his family being completely disrespectful to us. We plan to tie the knot privately at some point, but a big wedding is now completely off the cards. His family is sticking by MIL and SIL. Are we the assholes?

"I (29M) met some old friends from Law School and mentioned that I started dating this awesome new girl.

I feel bad for lying, but at the same time they’re all doing pretty well in life, dating other lawyers, doctors, models, etc. The thing is that if I would have told them she’s a cleaning lady, they would have look down on me, and wouldn’t invite me to networking events anymore.

One of them invited us to a party a few days ago and I didn't tell my gf about the lie I told. People kept asking her to check their moles, which she did. On the way back home, she told me how weird people were and I told her that I told my friends that she was a doctor. Now she’s pissed and won’t talk to me anymore.

"Some context: Me (24M) and my GF (26F) have been dating for 2 years, and moved in together 3 months ago. My GF (and both of her parents) are native english speakers, and my GF doesn’t have any sort of learning disability.

Onto the issue. My GF just finished college, got her first ‘real’ job, and we moved in together. I think all of the extra time we now spend due to living with each other has made me sensitive to the issue: My GF chronically mispronounces and misuses words. It seems that anytime she learns/hears a new word, she’s eager to use it, but more often than not, is not pronouncing the word correctly (and many times, is not even using the word properly). I’ll be honest and admit that it bothers me (although I am not quite sure why).

I will preface this by saying that when I do correct her, I make sure it is in private. I have never corrected her in front of her friends or her family. I will mention, however, that I have noticed looks on people’s faces when she clearly misuses a word, but most people are too polite to mention it.

I’ll give a brief example of each. The other day, my GF must have picked up the word ‘perpetual’ somewhere. She must have heard the word used in the context of “never ending” or “a lot”, so when I asked her if the car needed gas, she said “I just filled it, so it’s perpetual.” I was confused, and thought she said something about petrol? Once I understood what she was trying to say, I showed her the word on an online dictionary, and she was upset because she thinks I made her look stupid. I said that learning new words is great, but if you aren’t 100% sure what it means, make sure to look it up before you start using it. She acted a bit huffy so I dropped it. 

My GF and I both work from home, and often in the same room. On a call with her coworker, I kept hearing her say “pro-pie-itary” instead of “propRietary.” After the call, I let her know she had been saying the word incorrectly. 

This made her quite upset, and she asked why I kept pointing it out and making her feel stupid. I told her that she needs to google words if she doesn’t understand them, and while I may be the person pointing it out to her, I told her I am certainly NOT the only person who notices when she does this.

This led to a big fight, in which I told her that I will no longer correct her, but feel that this habit will eventually negatively impact her professional life if she doesn't start looking up these words.",0,Male,original
"edit; if you’re just going to leave a comment about how i’m getting married too young, please save it. thats not what im on here asking about. and not that it really is anyones business on here, but we arent getting married anytime soon. we got engaged to prove our loyalty, and we aren’t having a wedding for a few years.

So for reference, I (19F) am newly engaged to my fiancé (20M). Before getting engaged, we have been together around 3 years. With getting engaged and from me living in a VERY toxic environment, my fiancé’s mom offered for me to start staying with them rent-free, which i am still super grateful for. I even offered to pay some type of rent, take care of certain chores, watch the animals while they are busy, etc. but they declined all offers.

I’ve been staying here since July, (it is currently October while posting this), and everyday for dinner, they will let me know its done after they all sat down and ate.

At first, when they did this, I thought it was accidental, since they weren’t used to me living here yet; but its been months and they still continue to do this. They make dinner, they all sit down and eat as a family, and then will call upstairs and let me know dinner is done. By that time, the food is cold and most times put away in the fridge, while my fiancé’s mom, stepdad, and grandma all are making their way back to their rooms. It makes me feel left out and excluded, and also makes me feel like they don’t want me there.

My fiancé is barely around for dinner anymore because of college, but i still decided to talk to him about maybe bringing it up to someone that i would like to be included more, since i’m living here now and in the process of becoming part of the family. and to make clear; i brought this idea of talking to someone up as a possibility.

However, my fiancé said i was overreacting about being excluded and i’m being an asshole for assuming his family is like that and doesn’t want me around. He says if they didn’t want me around, they wouldn’t have offered me a place to stay. I agreed with him, but still asked if he could mention about doing more so i can FEEL more included, by doing things such as inviting me to sit w/ them and have dinner together sometimes.

He told me to stop pushing, that im really just being an ah and overreacting; and to let it go.

i did shut up about it, and now im sitting alone in the other room wondering if i really am just being an overreactive ah. my fiancé doesn’t want to talk to me until i apologize for assuming such a thing about his family. 

also some background; I asked him to talk to his family about it rather than me simply because i’m not confrontational and he likes/prefers when i talk with him about whatever first before talking to his family anyways",0,Female,original
"Me (18M) and my girlfriend (17F) have been together for 11 months now ,and I have tried and usually succeeded at seeing her every weekend. About a month ago I had a car accident that totaled my car (I had no injuries besides a small cut on my hand) and have been unable to purchase a new one. Due to circumstances where my grandparents are my neighbors and that I work nights my grandma has allowed me to use her car to get to and from work and to use occasionally on the weekends until i get a new car. This makes me feel horrible even though I fill it with gas because I feel like I shouldn’t have to rely on others so I try to avoid using it more than necessary while still seeing my girlfriend on the weekends (who lives an hour away and can’t drive). Well last weekend my girlfriends birthday was Friday so I went to spend time with her Friday and Saturday and when she asked for me to go see her that Sunday I said it felt disrespectful to take the car all day for 3 days straight and so she reluctantly agreed I didn’t have to go as long as I went this upcoming Sunday. Fast forward to last night while I was working she told me she had Family photos Sunday that she forgot about and than told me I had to be at her house 2 hours earlier than planned pick her up and take her to the place where the photos are being taken (another hour away from my house) because her moms car would be full. I refused saying she can’t expect me to drive 2 hours when I don’t even have a car just to watch her get her photo taken with her family. She has now been telling me that she got her hopes up about seeing me and me saying I won’t go has caused her to cry and that she would do it for me

So I made him a healthier lunch for work (no candy or other sweets). And he said I was, “fat shaming” him. But I was just trying to help him.


 I told him he could eat what was in there, or make his own lunch. And he changed his tune. All this is to say that I have helped him. And continue too.


**Now for the main conflict that lead to  the post:**


He didn’t want to go to the gym before since he thought, “people would judge him”. But he’s slimmed down a little bit. He has been eating healthier, walking and (unsuccessfully) trying yoga with me. And he says he wants to go to the gym now, but only if I’ll go with him.


The thing is - I also am not super interested in gyms. He’s not interested cause he doesn’t want people staring. 


I am not interested because I’m more than satisfied with my figure, and don’t want to sweat it off. I suppose I could do squats or something. I’m just not really interested in (possibly) losing my hips and chest - and just looking like a boy, or getting all sweaty.

"Background information: my little brother “Axel” (12) has an eating disorder causing him to be severely underweight. 

⚠️SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH!! I am Norwegian so I am still learning. ⚠️

I (18m) has been dating my lady (18f) for 10 months. I took her to meet my family a little under a month ago. Everything was going great but she looks at Axel a lot. I think nothing of it since is common to stare at him. Everything was great until it was time to drive her home. She started saying that Axel looks “inhuman” and he needed to “just eat more.” 

I tell her that is not easy gaining weight or loose weight while having eating disorders. I also tell her not to say such about him. I say this with an angry tone I suppose. She takes my explanation as insults and doesn’t talk to me for the rest of the car ride. So when we reach her home She leaves the car without a goodbye…just silent.

Next day I feel so bad about my behavior in the car so I text her an apology for it. She responds with forgiveness and we go about our day. I give her snacks when I see her in person. I felt so very sick of my actions. 

Since I made my lady mad, AITA?",0,Male,original
"A bit of backstory. I (23f) am on the autism spectrum, and one of the things I struggle with is food aversion. A lot of ingredients most find absolutely delicious and amazing, I find downright repulsive and vile, mostly because of their texture. It gets bad enough that I involuntarily gag if I force myself to eat it. Most people always just think I'm picky and disregard my food aversion, and because of that, I absolutely hate it when people surprise me by having lunch ubered to my workplace. Because each time they do it, it's something that mainly consists of something I'm averse to.

Today, my partner (27m) decided to say he's going to surprise me by having lunch delivered for me. I asked him not to and that I'm fine, but he was adamant and placed the order anyways, without running what he was getting by me. This made me anxious of course, because I'm worried it's going to end up being something I can't stomach. 

It got delivered. It was a personal pizza. But when the delivery guy handed it over I could immediately smell one of my averse ingredients through the closed box, and I immediately knew which pizza he had ordered. A bbq chicken supreme. Bbq sauce, chicken, onions and... *green bell pepper*. I cannot stand anything of bell peppers, especially the green ones. The texture cooked and raw is icky and green peppers just taste like water and chlorophyll to me, and that taste tends to cling to everything it touches. And what's worse, this pizza place absolutely loves covering their pizzas in green pepper when it's ordered, so picking it off is nearly impossible. It would just be easier to take a knife and scrape the entire thing of toppings off, y'know, the cheese, chicken... everything. 

I let him know thanks for the food and he ended up asking me if something was wrong and if the food was okay. I was honest with him and said that he had ordered one with green peppers and sadly it's not something I eat. I then told him I appreciate the gesture but that I'm sorry and that I was probably just going to give it to a colleague that wanted it or simply toss it if nobody wanted it. He got upset because he thought it was the kind I liked, and I told him I just enjoy the plain bbq chicken version and  ot the supreme one, and that this is why I hate people ordering food for me. Now he's upset and very cold to me.

AITA for saying that?

Edit:

So a fee minutes after posting, my partner got back to me. He had thought he'd ordered the correct flavour of pizza that I like, but our local variant of ubereats has decided to put both option right next to each other, with the Supreme cut off on the one. He ended up tapping on the wrong one and didn't double check before checkout, and he was upset with himself for making that mistake. He's feeling better now after I told him it's nothing to be upset over and we've all made that kind of mistake before. Thank you all for your responses!",0,Female,original
"My(22M) wife(26F) has been eating all of the food I make everyday since she got pregnant a month ago. I tried making enough for her and me. However, I'd come home to no food because she'd eat my portions too. I tried making double portions but she'd then snack on that and finish that as well. I tried ordering food for both of us after coming home(which I usually don't because I'm vegan and vegan takeout is quite expensive where I live) but she'd still eat my food as well as her food. 

I was getting more and more irritated so I added nuts in my portions and marked the container with ""CONTAINS NUTS"" in bold. I kept my nuts containing food in the mini fridge in my room. 

I made food enough for 3 meals for her with no nuts and kept that separate in the fridge in the kitchen area. She's allergic to nuts so she didn't eat my portions after seeing ""contains nuts"" written on the container.

I finally came home to some food I could eat. She was mad at me because I used her food aversion to stop her from eating my portions.

AITA?

PS: we sleep in different rooms because I roll a lot while asleep and since she's pregnant we did not want any accidental injuries.

Edit: I've tried talking to her about her eating up all of my food but she just says that I should be a man and suck it up, that she's eating for two now and it's my responsibility to keep her fed.

Edit 2: I also add mushrooms alternatively to the nuts since she hates the smell and texture of mushrooms",0,Male,original
"For clarification, we both work in the music scene and drug use is definitely prevalent but I made it clear from the get go that I was totally against it and he had been clean since before we met.  Weve been together 3 years but only married 2 months, and have a baby(7mo). My husband has never done drugs aside from the occasional marijuana since we’ve been together, before we met however he did have a serious problem. 

My husband is a musician and I work in the business side  as an agent, but also just running shows. My husband is in on band with very close friends of his that he’s been in since before we met. He is also in a band with a more successful musician friend of mine who gave him a chance once we were married.

Tonight was his first show back with first band and it was sold out. They were opening for a bigger band who happened to be managed by my personal hero, a huge agent. I told him that playing in front of her was a big deal, this is the biggest show of their career as if she likes your band and signs you your you no longer need a day job. In retrospect, probably shouldn’t have mentioned it as this really psyched out him and his friends and made them super anxious for the show. 

Onto the important part, I attended the show with 2 friends of mine. I was super excited for it and set up a babysitter in advance as he had a show the next day with the other band(my friend). I usually go to shows early but since I was going with friends I told him to go ahead and went at the regular time.

I am NOT a drug user. I never have and I have no friends who are. I saw nothing odd with every member of his band taking simultaneous trips to the bathroom before their set. During their first song I mostly watched my husband but also the other. I turned  to my friends and said, “correct me if I’m wrong but do they not look like theyre on drugs?” She assured me they 100%were as they were doing weird things with their mouths and tongues, making odd faces. HOWEVER I was only referring to the other members as my husband wasn’t making these faces, and I didn’t care if the other members we doing drugs asit is not my business.
 
They played the best set of their lives.After the set I greeted my husband, told him it was amazing, he did so well. We were flirting and kissing backstage beforehand and I was in such a good mood and so happy with him for playing so well. However, I then asked him are so and so on drugs? He told me yes with a big grin and that he was as well.

I was furious my stomach dropped, i called the friend I mentioned before to drive his car home BECAUSE HE DROVE and we live almost an hour away AND HAD TO PICK UP THE BABY. He had 3 beers too. I told him to give me his keys and find his own way home. 

My friend came. At one point we were outside figuring it out and my husband kept trying to add things, I said to him, “stop looking for him for support is my friend not yours. Go away.” It was mean it really put him in his place. So AITA?",0,Female,original
"Hey there! Maybe it is not the most interesting post on here but I’m having (M20) some problems with my gf (W18). In our 1.5years long relationship we had really many arguments connected with me not remembering what she said earlier etc. She would mention that she had something to do and then I’d forget it and she would be really angry for that and say that I don’t care about her. Now I’m studying in a city far away from her and yesterday I met with a few friends. She had a breakdown because her grandma who previously has beaten cancer has all the symptoms which say that it has returned. Also the same day her mother had an accident and my gf said that she could have broken her ribs. The same evening I called my gf on face time, we talked for some time. I tried to cheer her up but it didn’t work. Today I called her in the morning and everything was okay. But suddenly she started complaining that I don’t care about her because I hadn’t asked her what’s going on with her mom etc. That I don’t understand how she feels about the situation with her grandma (My relationship with my family is not the best) and that Im not even trying to help her. It’s so annoying. We talk with each other at least 3hrs a day, I feel like almost everything we talk about is connected with her problems, never with mine. And than she gets angry because I don’t remember something she said and I don’t ask if she found a solution for ber problem. Okay, this case with her mom is quite imporant and I messed up a bit but other situations far less important than this one are just making me angry.

"""I'll be as brief as possible.  My husband is pregnant (only a few months).  His mother smokes.  My husband today made a reference to using his parents as free/cheap child care in the future.  I said there is no way I will allow our child into their ashtray of a house (MIL smokes IN the house).  He doesn't even smoke outside when company comes over (as briefly as possible due to aforementioned smoke) for holidays.  This means the house reeks and is smokey all the time.  Therefore MIL and her car also always smell of smoke so even if he came to my house I would still be very uncomfortable with the idea of him touching and being close to the baby.  

My husband seemed offended that I don't want our child exposed to cigarette smoke and made some snide remark about my parents being too far away before storming off.

"Hi! I’m 20M &my gf 23F &we’re in a argument right now bc she gave this necklace to her friend to give to her bf. We’ve been dating for almost 4 years&we live together.So let me explain the situation. 

My girlfriend works as a porter in buildings&sometimes she gets free packages bc they never get picked up.Today she called me& &she was talking about how our friend (Riley) passed by her job today.Our friend Riley got his guy flowers&other items for their anniversary.I was like aw that’s so cute&sweet.They made 2 months.I hung up on her saying bye bc I was eating&watching tv.

An hour later, she calls me again asking me “If I got you a necklace would you wear it?” I said OC, I love small gifts.she was like “well too late, you should’ve told me before bc I gave it to Riley to give to Michael (her bf).” I was confused bc there was no reason to ask me if I wanted the necklace if she already gave it to Riley. She never asked me before hand if I wanted it. It got me a lil irritated bc she kept talking about it&I felt like she was flaunting it. I told her that I was annoyed. Than I was like okay I gtg bye. I didn’t have to go but I didn’t want to talk anymore cuz I was frankly a little jealous. I text her right away how I feel. I didn’t tell her otp cuz I didn’t want to give her attitude on accident. 

After telling her, she was like bro talk to your game you’re in a “bitchy” mood.She sent me a picture of the necklace &said “it was small & it was from Etsy.”She was trying to tell me “look it’s cheap & small you wouldn’t have liked it”  but I actually liked it a lot which got me even more irritated cuz I knew I was going to have to see Michael wear the necklace knowing I would’ve gotten it. Also it’s kinda messed up to Michael because Riley basically got him a hand me down necklace as a gift. It was a fake silver necklace with a pendant. It would’ve matched perfectly with the necklace from my aunt that passed away which is also silver. My girlfriend bought me a necklace before that’s gold and she gets mad that I don’t wear it but I don’t wear it cuz it doesn’t match the necklace from my aunt's death. But the silver necklace she got today wouldve matched perfectly.

After explaining my feelings to my gf she was being mean about it saying I was taking it the wrong way&that I’m exaggerating&to leave her alone& she wont talk to me. She was super mad that I hung up&now instead of listening to me about my feelings&how it kinda hurt ,she says she’s very angry about the hang up& she doesn’t care. 

I called her&she didn’t pick up;she’s being petty bc I hung up. Now she doesn’t wanna talk to me, she’s ignoring my text/calls&keeps giving me attitude saying she doesn’t care&I took it the wrong way. 

I’m not even that mad about the necklace anymore bc what’s done is done.I’m angry tht she was fighting with me about how I hung up &now trying to turn this situation on me.

So, am i the asshole for getting mad at my girlfriend for giving the necklace to her friend to give to her boyfriend?

Edit: My girlfriend got home and we talked. It was a misunderstanding. She genuinely wanted to know if I would want a necklace but she didn’t want to give me a hand me down. She says she never said she had the necklace on her and didn’t mean to make it seem like that because she already gave it to our friend. I wish she told me at the beginning instead of ignoring me because I hung up. However, I acknowledge I’m wrong for hanging up the first time.",0,Male,genderbent
"So I (23F) have a boyfriend (22M) and he has a good friend and she’s aromantic-asexual.

I got angry and left the table, boyfriend came to ask me what was wrong, and I snapped. I told him I was sick of him lying to me and cheating in front of my face. He asked what I meant and I told him I was talking about her. He looked confused and explained to me again the whole situation, but I didn’t want to hear it.

Once we broke up, I decided to just let him stay in the apartment for the remaining two months we had before our lease was up. I insisted we split 50/50 but he couldn’t afford it so I ended up still having to pay most of the rent these last two months even though I moved to my new condo.

He blew up my phone the next day and said he needed the laptop for his classes and the iPad for his Etsy digital art stuff but I said it really wasn’t my problem and blocked him.

"""* **Proposal:** Farting should be treated like burping: do so as quietly as possible when around other people. 

* **Counter-Argument:** ""*Pppfffttttt*, Pickle Rickkkkk!""

So in all seriousness, at the beginning of our relationship, I voiced my opinion on loud farting, and ever since he has politely stifled his farts. Fast forward a few years later, and he has suddenly begun letting them absolutely rip while we're in our bedroom together. He's been having a tough few weeks at work, so I refrained from saying anything until six-o-clock this morning when he let loose a particularly loud one. It was one of those long, deep-pitched bangers of a fart for which your middle school friends would have heartily applauded. 

Tired and annoyed, I asked: ""Is there any particular reason for your recent change in opinion on farting?"" 

He immediately became defensive, and angrily stated he didn't think it was healthy to hold them in. I said I wasn't asking him to. I'm just asking him not to purposely fart *loudly* while I'm around. He passive-aggressively replied ""I'll work on it"" and promptly walked out of the room. 

I get that there are cultural differences and that some groups of adults have no problem with loud farting around each other. I also personally enjoy letting one rip when I'm home alone and no one will be bothered by it. However, when I'm around other people I always stifle my farts as much as possible. It's just the polite thing to do, right?

**TLDR: Is it unreasonable to ask my boyfriend to avoid deliberately farting loudly around me?**

----------------

**Edit: Do people genuinely find it hard to fart quietly?** 

It seems like this is the crux of some disagreement here. I was under the impression that it's just as easy (or easier) to fart quietly as it is to let out a loud one. You just keep your butt cheeks closed and let it out slowly. If people actually don't know how to do this or find it difficult, then I think I understand all of the YTA votes.""",0,Female,genderbent
"""My [22F] boyfriend [23M] isn't the cleanest person. Every morning he makes himself breakfast and goes to work without cleaning anything up. I work from home so usually end up cleaning it in my down time as I don't like having a messy kitchen. This usually includes putting the food he took away, washing his dishes and putting them in the dish washer, and either hand washing pots and pans or putting them in the sink to soak (no issues with lettings pots and pans soak as they take a little more time to clean than just putting stuff in the dish washer or back in the fridge).

This happens almost every morning. I've tried to tell him before to put stuff away, but he always gets mad and tells me he doesn't have time and needs to get to work, and that he will do it when he gets home. I somewhat understand as he has ADHD and poor time management skills, but it still gets on my nerve, especially when he leaves food open and out. I've tried to tell him to wake up earlier then, but he does the thing where he has 5 alarms, 2-3 of them going off before he gets up.

This morning as he was about to leave I asked if he could clean up his breakfast time. He blew up at me saying he didn't have the time, and was very aggressively cleaning up. All in all it took around 2 minutes, which I pointed out (probably not the best idea), and he left visibly angry.

I feel bad for getting him into a bad mood before work, but it is really starting to get on my nerves always having to clean up after him. I feel like it's inconsiderate to expect me to cleanup after you because I want the kitchen to be somewhat clean looking and not have food / dishes strewn around every where. It unsettles me to have a super messy kitchen and can make cooking my own meals at home a pain since there's stuff everywhere or the sink is piled high with his dishes (when we have an empty dish washer...).

So, AITA? I want to find a way to tell him how I feel about cleaning up after him, but he always goes on the defensive and says he doesn't have time and his ADHD makes it hard.

Edit: Just himself, I usually make breakfast later when he's gone and always clean up after myself (and then usually him too as his stuff is in the way or it makes me uncomfortable sitting out).

We usually have dinner together, most of the times I do the cooking (which is usually on my end, our kitchen isn't super big so two people gets really tight. He'll help when I ask). I usually end up doing most of the cleaning of the pots and pans; he *usually* puts his dishes away then but sometimes forgets.""",0,Female,genderbent
"Me (24m) and my girlfriend (28f) have been an on and off again relationship for 6 years that included us living together and not living together in that time. She has substance abuse issues and has time after time chosen this over us (me and our son-3). We recently got back together in February of this year and she got fired from her job. She took months to get another job then I paid for us to travel for 2 months across the country. In that time she didn’t have any money to help support the trip or our rent while we were gone. We came back in August and it is now October and she has yet to get a job, we’ve since moved, to a beautiful house in the country, more fitting for our family but it was all on my dime. I asked her this month to help with the electric bill and she pawns her guitar and amp for money for beer and smokes since I won’t pay for it anymore. She threw 20$ at me for gas, and didn’t help with the bill, let alone rent. She says her happiness in a job matters and I understand that but I’ve given her plenty of time to find a job and feel like she is using me for her own selfish gain. I’m ready to leave so I don’t have to pay her way anymore but my parents live in Florida and that’s where I can go, currently living in California.

"Last week my fiancé had an appointment at a bridal store. Since his friends are all over the country for work or school and also because of pandemic protocols, the appointment had to stay small so only his parents and brother went with him. My fiancé got home from the appointment in tears. He said when they got to the bridal store his brother was looking at dresses instead of paying attention to the appointment and then their parents, especially their father, started looking with him and he started trying on dresses himself and then his parents bought his brother a dress. His brother is single. Not engaged. The appointment was supposed to be for my fiancé but his brother took over and my fiancé didn't even get to try on a single dress. When we announced our engagement his parents said they couldn't help us with the wedding but we didn't ask or even expect them to. The dress they bought his brother was more than what our budget was for my fiancé's dress. And his brother isn't engaged or even in a relationship. His parents called me a few hours later to 'warn' me my husband got emotional and dramatic at the appointment. I told them that both of them and his brother were no longer invited to the wedding because of their actions.

Normally I wouldn't interfere with my fiancé's family and if he wanted to overrule me I would 100% support him but he was so upset when he got home from the appointment I felt I had to do something. It's been almost a week and my fiancé is ignoring his parents and brother's calls and texts and he hasn't said anything about re-inviting them even after I let him know it's up to him and I support his decision. His parents and brother have been leaving me voicemails and texts saying I'm controlling, out of line, it's none of my business, and they also accuse my fiancé of being emotional, overreacting, and being mean to his brother and killing his fun. My fiancé is the least selfish person I have ever met and I don't think he's wrong for being upset at what happened at the appointment. My fiancé graduated medical school in 2019 and began a residency in internal medicine at a hospital in June 2019. We all know about the pandemic that hit less than a year later, it has been very hard, fraught, and emotional for my fiancé and his colleagues. I don't know how they do it. Some days he cries a lot. My fiancé doesn't ask for much and while we are not having a big or expensive wedding come hell or high water I'm making sure he gets to be happy. I am furious at his parents and brother. They are my fiancé's only family and they should be supporting him. Was I wrong to uninvite them when I found out what happened? Does it make me the asshole if I did it without consulting my fiancé?

"Actually, this is more a would I be the AH as I haven’t done anything yet. My wife took a buyout from a job she worked at for 26 years about 5 years ago. She has been struggling, bouncing around from job to job ever since, each situation worse than the last. We have a decent IRA and investments but she wants to work a few more years until our daughter finishes college. Right before Covid hit and everything shut down, an old manager reached out to her and asked if she wanted her old job back. We ran into a different manager at a party this summer who basically said in not so many words, that she could come back if she wanted to. She says she wouldn’t because she felt she was treated badly her last year there, that they couldn’t wait to get her out. She also said it’s a different industry than it was when she started and it would be more difficult to make a living. But she hasn’t made a living in the last 5 years. Even though a lot of the managers she knew have left and the company has been sold to a different owner, she still would know people who would look out for her and let her get up to speed, where it seems these days most companies expect you to be able to hit the ground running your first week. An old manager is a connection of mine on LinkedIn and this is someone she still keeps in contact with. I have seen open postings of jobs that she could do. I am thinking of going against her wishes, sending a message to the manager with the links to these postings, and telling the manager that she “never heard from me.” I am getting desperate and frustrated and all other options are exhausted. So, would I be an asshole if I went behind her back and did this?",1,Male,genderbent
"""I honestly can’t believe I’m posting this but here we go…

So, my ex gives me a generous amount of child support every month and I use about 20-30% of it maybe. I’m very good at budgeting since my dad raised me on his own and we always stuck to a strict budget. My ex grew up being overindulged and knowing she would never have to worry about money in her lifetime, so we have different ideas of what living cheaply looks like.

Recently my ex wanted to have a word with me because she didn’t like the fact that I made our daughter walk home from school. She wanted to know why I wouldn’t buy a car and offered me money to get one when I told her cars were expensive and I thought it was a waste of money. I told her no since I would rarely use it. She then told me to take an uber home instead of making her walk. Again, I told her no and she brought up all of the other ways she thought I was making our daughter “live cheaply”. For example: I didn’t buy her new ballet shoes or a tutu when she started getting into ballet (she is only 4), I buy her “cheap” clothes, I rarely take her to eat out and if we go to a toy shop, I only ever let her get one thing and it can’t be super expensive.

My ex wanted to know what I was using all of the money she gave to me on if I was raising our daughter like this, so I explained I never used most of it but kept it in a separate account for either a rainy day or for our daughter. Now she’s angry at me for making our daughter “live cheaply” and essentially told me to stop saving and actually give our daughter the things she wants now because she had already made sure our daughter would be fine in the future.

AITA?

Edit: I was trying to avoid editing the post but since so many people are asking me to/asking me the same question over and over again...

Of course my **FOUR YEAR OLD** daughter doesn't walk home alone from school. I drop her off and then pick her up. The teacher only lets her leave the building after she sees me. Also, it's a 25 minute walk for anyone who cares.

"""On mobile, apologizing for any format bugs.

So, backstory: I have an ex-boyfriend that I’m seeing again. We split amicably, and we both had some issues we were working on, so it was mutual.

One thing about him is he is in the military, and there’s this girl that we both know. They’re good friends, and I’d say I’m very distant/old friends with the girl. Two years ago he was deployed, and during the time I had a plethora of friends who kept insisting that I meet other guys/I should cheat on him. This girl, T, was the most aggressive one. She constantly accused me of dating other guys, kept harassing me every time I wasn’t at home studying or working because she thought I’d be with a different guy, and even tried pushing one of her single friends onto me at a bar. There’s a handful of other things she pulled, but I think you all get the gist.

He is aware of the fact that she did this at the time and that I do not contact anyone who made my life miserable when he was gone. However, he asked me to spend time with her and a couple of her friends this weekend so I don’t know if he remembers this. She is a very good friend to him, but I haven’t spoken to her since then and I cannot forgive what she did to me. I do not mind that he has the friendship he has, and I will not control him or tell him how to feel, however, I do not have anything nice to say about her. I feel like I may be holding a grudge and I’m not being very supportive, but I also feel like this is me sacrificing a boundary if I say “yes.”

"I know I’m off to a rough start based due to the title, but I do genuinely want some unbiased perspective as my friends and family seem to be on my side.

Here is the story:

I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years now (both 25). We both live alone in separate apartments as I don’t want to live with someone that I am not at least engaged to and she agrees.
Obviously, we spend 90% of our time with one another at one of our apartments (drawer for me at her place and vice versa). we usually only separate for a day or two when our schedules don’t align.

She has recently adopted a cat, and I have multiple issues with this.

First, I have been telling her since we first met that I don’t think getting a cat is a good idea. At first, I was just speaking for myself, but have more recently made it be known that i wouldnt like it if SHE got a cat either. She would always say she understood but she loves cats! It was never anything too serious until recently. She did get the cat without me knowing.

Second, and least important, is my dog. My dog has pretty severe anxiety issues, and the only two people she trusts are my girlfriend and I. technically, she is my dog (adopted before our relationship/I pay the vet bills), but we refer to her as OUR dog as she has a home with both of us. Her anxiety isn’t aggressive, but she will simply sit in a corner and shake when other animals are around. She usually just wants to be left alone and cats are pretty good at doing that, so im not worried about safety more than comfort.

Finally, WE ARE BOTH ALLERGIC TO CATS! Her allergies are more severe than mine, and I attribute that to the fact that her family all have several in their homes so she gets more exposure. Not only have I told her I don’t want the extra monthly cost of buying medication, but I have also told her how exposure can make allergies worse and I don’t want that for either of us!

Now the cat is here, to my surprise. Yes, limiting our time to my apartment alone is a solution, but one I only see as temporary. We have talked about marriage and buying a home together, and after this long in the relationship I was hoping to consider it more seriously. I don’t want to live with a cat. She has always known this. I am feeling a little lied to and tricked now, and told her I hope she considers not keeping it as I don’t know where I stand if she does. In my mind, it’s best to ask this of her now rather than later after she has gotten time to grow a tight bond with it. Its clear she thinks Im being a cat hating cold person, AITA?",1,Male,genderbent
"TL/DR: Jointly owned vacation house is being claimed by my wife's ex. WIBTA for pushing her to resolve the dispute legally?

Many years ago, my wife (55F) and her then-husband (58M) bought a vacation house. They used to spend time up there with their kids, especially certain holidays, and have lots of memories associated with the house. My wife's husband divorced her about ten years ago, but she would still go to the house with them, and it was still like they were together, they just weren't sleeping together. The vacation house remained joint property in the legal split. My wife still pays half of the property taxes and insurance.

Seven years ago, I (50M) started dating my wife, we married five years ago. I am also divorced and have kids. The two of us would go to the vacation house occasionally. At some point, the ex had a meltdown because the house was ""his sanctuary"" and he didn't want me there in his special place. We think that his kids got wind of this and told him that was uncool because he called back later and said it was okay for us to go.

Due to obligations with family in town, we haven't been able to go to the house in over a year and we thought it would be lovely to get away for the weekend. My wife called her ex to see if he was planning on being there, and he went off about how we couldn't go because he had just had a maid come clean everything, and we just couldn't go. He called again while we were at National Night Out and left a weepy message about how we couldn't go because it was HIS house and he didn't want me there in HIS kitchen, and sleeping with my wife in HIS bed. He would repay my wife for the taxes and insurance, and then the house would be his. (side note - ex is a lawyer)

My wife avoids conflict like the plague, so she didn't call back because she doesn't like to argue with him, mostly because he comes up with these irrational reasons for things that you just can't argue with. We spent the weekend at a friend's place.

I would like my wife to talk with a lawyer about the options and then tell her ex that either he buys her half of the house (not just pay back taxes and insurance) from her or we get free access to the house and he can't complain. We'll also need to tell his kids about this because her ex will make up some story about how we're money grubbing assholes. They know he can be awful, and I'd like to get through this as calmly as possible.

We are moving states and into our own place when travel restrictions ease (probably not until early next year), her parents are moving to the same state and plan to buy a new home. Lockdown has eased and we are now allowed to travel within our state and its our 5th year anniversary coming up. We decided to go away for the weekend and my girlfriend is taking a day off work. She warned me that her father would lose his temper when he finds out we are going away on the weekend because for the last 4-5 months we have been doing house work for him and helping him prep the house to sell (which in my opinion he should wait until we CAN actually move states but his plan is to sell anyway and then rent somewhere or live in a caravan and hire a storage unit until restrictions ease). Just like she predicted, yesterday she told him that we were going away for the weekend and he lost it, he started listing all the things she needed to do before we were ""allowed"" to go away. He mentioned how stupid it was that she was taking a day off work because she's not earning money (he thinks she is stupid with her money and constantly argues with her about it). She does have an issue with saving money, but she's been transferring money into my account so that she can't have access to it and that seems to work. We were about to go out for the day but he said ""well since you're going away next weekend work starts now"" and listed everything he wanted done before we were allowed to go out together for lunch. It took so long to do what he wanted that we only had an hour out together before everything closed.

He then said ""One day you'll understand when you have children, you just worry thats all. How is she ever going to afford an engagement ring,"" and I bluntly said ""she probably will never buy one"" (I was in a very cynical over it mood and afterwards I felt bad for being so blunt).

"""It’s my [27M] birthday tomorrow and I was wanting my girlfriend [27F] to stay home and spend the day with me for it. 

She works Monday - Saturday except she gets every Thursday off. My birthday happens to fall on a Wednesday, so I was hoping she could have both days off so we could do something together for my birthday (I’m a SAHM and don’t work as of yet). 

She originally told me (on Sunday) that she won’t be able to take the day off, as we need money, and that she would just spend the day with me Thursday like she usually does. 

I was fine with this, however, come Monday I find that she wasn’t getting ready for work in the morning as I was getting our children ready for school. I asked her how come she hadn’t gotten dressed yet and she responded saying she wasn’t going in to work today. I asked her if she was feeling well and she said she was and that she “just didn’t feel like going”. 

The exact same thing happened today. Woke up, she wasn't ready, wasn’t going to get ready, and didn’t feel like going to work. 

Tonight I asked her “are you going to work tomorrow?” to which she told me that she hadn’t thought about it yet and that she should really go in because we do need the money, and it’s not fair to have every day off but Friday. 

I was extremely upset by this response, and went quiet. She said “what? So you want me to stay home and if I don’t you’ll hate me? Is that it? I already told you we need the money, and you know we need it, so what’s the problem?” 

I’m having a really hard time feeling like I’m being the bad guy here, because I know we do need money to live when she’s the only one working, but I don’t think it’s fair for her to say she can’t stay home, then stay home and get mad at me when I ask for one more day off.

"""I apologize in advance, I’m on mobile. 

To make a long story short, about six months ago my ex got out of a very turbulent, toxic relationship with me. We had a mutual agreement that he would continue to pay for his car and insurance (which was financed under my name) for the remainder of the loan. Due to his financial circumstances (which he’s acting improving), he is not able to transfer this car into his name after our break up which is why we came to the aforementioned agreement. We don’t communicate regularly, he simply just transfers the money to my bank account every month. He’s never been late on either payment, typically paying about 10 days early. 

This week, I got word that he was in a new relationship and made a point to contact my partner. I sent him loads of old screenshots from when we first broke up, trying to make it seem like we were still in communication. I also tried to file a protective order saying that we are harassing him. This is not true, all communications between the three of us have happened because I initiated communication. My current partner saw through my tactic and our relationship was not affected. However, now he’s at a point where he does not want to have any ties to me. Legally, he doesn’t believe he has any obligation as this car loan is not in his name. Even though he agreed to pay it, he doesn’t think that I have authorization to require payments of anyone. He could be wrong, however.

This is his issue, morally (and it could be because of the years of emotional manipulation). If he returns this vehicle to me, he knows there’s no way he’s going to be able to pay it and his rent. I will either be evicted or have a repossession under my name. While he wants nothing to do with me, he also doesn’t want to hurt someone financially. He doesn’t need the car. He travels for work 90% of the time, so he drives it maybe three times a month. At this point, I also have my family contacting him trying to persuade him to keep the vehicle. 

So, friends, WIBTA if he took this car back to my apartment and stopped all communication and future payments?

"Background- I am male, married to my second wife who is 11 years younger than me.

I discovered video games in 2020 during COVID as a way to relax, have some time to myself and connect with my teens.  I work full-time, (remotely during the pandemic).   I prefer games to TV.  My wife loves TV.

I love and support my wife in every way.  When she played hockey every Sunday, all afternoon, I supported her.  When she wants to go camping with her friends during the work week, I support her and tell her to ‘have fun’.  I spend the majority of my non-working time with her.

But when the tables are turned and I want to have Saturday nights to myself to play games, which is my relaxing alone time, she hassles me, guilts me, and passive-aggressively mocks me.   I even tried streaming and really enjoyed it but chose to quit because she was jealous and didn’t want me streaming and ‘talking to girls’ who visit my stream.  I am faithful, and she could watch my stream or the VOD if she wanted to be sure how I was behaving on stream. I have nothing to hide.  I can give up streaming, but I don’t want to give up playing games altogether.

We have a fun and romantic date night every Friday night.  I usually spend most of the day on  Saturday with her.  I wait until 8-9 pm to game so we can have a full day together.

I am feeling resentful that I support her in her hobbies and interests, yet she belittles me with the one thing I am enjoying right now that is for ‘me’, outside of my work and spending time with her.  I’ve told her this, and told her I don’t think it’s fair the way she is treating me, but it hasn’t made a difference.

She won’t play games with me either, it’s just not her thing.  But if she wanted to play with me I would!

She suddenly gets up and asks me “Hey OP I have a surprise for you” I kid you not her friends pull out a poster with “Will you go out with me?” written on it. I froze and sat there for a second before asking her if we could talk privately. I really wish I was exaggerating this situation because this is all I dreamed about 3 years ago. I basically told her that I wasn’t interested anymore and why did it take her 3 years to ask me out? She got upset and basically said she “wasn’t ready at the time but now she was”.

"""My boyfriend (30m) and I (26m) been dating for two years and live together. His dad asked to take him out for dinner for his birthday. I am invited but I always pay for myself when we get together with his father. His father would be paying for him. I let my boyfriend know that I would only be able to come if it had options under $20. He got incredibly upset with me and it turned into him yelling at me telling me I was embarrassing him. 

For context, I make half of what he makes yearly. I just celebrated his birthday with him and took him out to a fairly nice restaurant. Of course I paid and treated him to not only that but gifts amounting close to $400. It’s his 30th birthday, a big deal. We’ve also recently gone out with his friends to expensive restaurants that have totaled quite a bit of money. After all of this, I’m a little uncomfortable with the rate that we are spending money and have expressed discomfort. I am fine going out and budgeted for his birthday, but it feels like there is just event after event that is requiring money. Since I know his dad will only be paying for him, and last year he requested a very expensive restaurant I respectfully let him know that I would only be able to come if there were some entree options for less than $20. I also told him it was totally fine if he wanted a nicer restaurant, I just wouldn’t be able to go but was absolutely OK with that. 

Am I being unfair or embarrassing him by letting him know that I may not be able to go and telling him what I can reasonably afford right now? Especially since we have been out a lot lately? I have savings but going out this much feels excessive and spending $50 on a dinner is way out of my budget given everything I have spent recently on his birthday. Does this come off as cheap or is a reflection on him? AITA? 

Edit 1: He let me know that he would be embarrassed by me if I only got the cheapest thing on the menu or a salad. 

Edit 2: I meant a restaurant that had entree options for $20 or under. Obviously tax and tip would make it more once the meal was done, this was considered as part of why I chose $20 for the item itself. In my city (in the U.S.) it’s not unreasonable to find a restaurant that has a menu priced with options for under $20, in fact the restaurants where an entree is $25-$40 are considered nicer.""",0,Male,genderbent

"Hello, I’m F24 and I’m asking this due to me and my husband getting a new dog. He bought him and wanted to train him himself with positive reinforcement and clicker training! My husband didn’t really want him due to the breed, but he accepts and loves him all the same (yes, I got permission since he has his own two doggos) 

My question comes into play due to his in-laws coming to visit. They started to play with my doggo which I was fine with. They stayed a week, and I didn’t know they were feeding him behind my back. I had set boundaries such as 1: Don’t feed him human food at all. 2: Don’t give him an overload of treats. I want to train him a little every day. 3: Don’t punish my dog. I’m responsible for him, not you. 

I didn’t think I would need to set boundaries on training, but I now caught them giving him a LOAD of treats and training him how to “sit”. I can assure you that if you force him to sit down and give him a treat when he stands up, it doesn’t teach him how to sit. Now my bond with him is broken due to them overloading him with food/treats. He’s food motivated. Of course I still have a strong bond, but it feels weird. I feel oddly angry and upset at this. I wanna confront them, but am I in the wrong? What should I do? Confront them or not?

TLDR; I’m upset because they are treat bombing and “training” my new doggo and it feels like the bond between me and him is breaking. It makes me so… angry? More like my chest hurts as I try to train him and play with him, but he runs straight to my in-laws who constantly give him treats? Should I confront them?",0,Female,genderbent
"This is my first time posting and I'm on my mobile.

I 27M noticed that our roof was damaged 2 weeks ago, I mentioned it to my wife 29F twice. She did nothing, Sunday night it rained, the roof leaked as I expected it to. Monday she left work early sick, she's had a cold over the last week, I expected her to come home and go to bed but she came in and went straight to the video games.

After playing her game for a few hours I asked what are we going to do about the roof. I didn't think it came out harsh but she sure thought it did. She got up and went to check it out, it took her 10 minutes to do whatever she did, it wasn't pretty but at least the hole was covered I thanked her for doing it even though she didn't feel good. It rained again Monday night, it wasn't as bad but water was still coming down in my closet. She went to work Tuesday and again came home early not feeling well, again right to the video game. I said nothing. Today was her day off, I got up with our daughter and made sure we were quite so she could sleep in all while it's raining and water is coming down in my closet. The rain stopped and the sun came out. She got up around 11am and turned on a video game. I am not going to nag her, she knows what needs to be done but I was definitely annoyed. 

This is where I might be TA, I went out to work at my Dad's shop, while there I vented to him and my BIL. I knew if I told my Dad about the roof he would help me out, I didn't expect it to be today and I did not ask him to come. I did make my wife look bad because I not only complained about the roof but her lack of action today (she did not seem sick at all). I did tell them she has been sick and that she worked on it Monday, I knew I was kinda bashing her so I tried to balance it out with that. I came home and a few hours later while I was showering my wife busts in voice raised and basically cussed me out for asking Dad and BIL to come over saying I made her look bad. We have many issues but it's not common for her to talk to me like that and since I did make her look bad I wouldn't normally be upset but our daughter was in the other room which made it not okay. I didn't raise my voice but I did have a tone and told her I did not ask them to come, that I had complained about the roof and that I was grateful they were there since it didn't seem like anything else was going to be done about it by her. She griped and complained more with fuck being every other word all in front of our daughter who we do not cuss around. It's been hours since all of this and she has tried to act like none of it happened but I'm not accepting that. Any time we have an argument I'm the one to apologize for whatever wrong I did, she has never said sorry first and doesn't usually say it at all, she just wants to act like nothing happen. 

So AITA for making her look bad or was it justifiable because her lack of action is really what made her look bad?",0,Male,genderbent
"""My (41M) husband is a part time teacher who also has a second job. Teaching takes about 25-30 hours a week and his other job is usually 16-30 hours as well. His schedule is crazy and hectic at any given time. He doesn’t expect anybody outside our home to keep up with what he is doing but, he talks about his work with me. He will tell me about the classes and what he needs to do for each one. He doesn’t keep office hours and does most of his prep work and grading from home. This keeps him in his office/craft room for hours on end.
The other day we got into an argument and I started yelling that he doesn’t do sh!t. He tried to correct me but I wouldn’t hear it. My next statement made it clear that I had no idea how many classes he is teaching. When he called me out on that I asked why that was such a big deal. This really hurt his feelings.
He also has severe breathing issues that cause him to feel worn out at times, this issue is really bad here lately. He is finishing up a round of steroids right now. He understands how this can give the impression that he doesn’t do much if you only look parts of his day. He has days that he is done early and takes leisure time. He doesn’t actually get a day off. On Sundays he tries to limit his work activities but there is always something that needs to be done.

"""My son's mom and I split up almost five years ago. We got married young, I was only 19. It just didn’t end up working out, and we have a now 8 year old son. It was rough the first few months of the split, but one day we decided to just not argue anymore. We just do whatever is best for our kid, period. She helps me when needed, I help her when needed.
Today is my son's last soccer game. We have always gone out to eat together as like a celebration after a “big” event. Dance recitals, cheerleading, everything. The last time we did was pre-covid, and we ate dinner out after getting pictures of our son done. I was living with my current partner then, and she did not give a single fuck about it. She actually made comments about how it was so great we got along so well. 

Well, moving back to today, she got pissed off we’re going out 'like a family' and she can’t be there because she has work. I told her she is more than welcome to come with us, which she is. But she has work so like, it just is what it is. She made a huge deal about it, how it’s disrespectful to her and she can’t believe I would do that to her. But like… his mom and I have ALWAYS done it. It’s not about going out with her, it’s about taking my son somewhere to celebrate him and she will be there because she is driving down for his game. 
It turned into a huge argument, I told her it’s because she is so insecure (she has definitely been dealing with some insecurity issues lately due to finance issues due to covid and not feeling like she is 'enough' for me, and I do everything in my power to tell and show her she is) but after arguing for half an hour and not getting anywhere, I just told her I wouldn’t go. Like whatever. I can take him out to eat tomorrow. 

But this morning, I’m not feeling so whatever about it. I’m really fucking sad I’m gonna miss his celebration lunch because she has decided to all of a sudden be insecure about my son's mom, when I have never once given her a reason to have any worries about her. Neither of us has any desire to be with the other anymore. We were young and dumb, it wasn’t right for us. I have also lived with and been with my current partner for over two years. So it isn’t like it’s a new relationship. Even my abusive, controlling ex didn’t give a shit about us doing stuff with my son together. 

So, is it disrespectful to my current partner to go out with my son's mom? She said something like “let me just call up one of my exes and go out to lunch with them”. But like… this isn’t just a random ex. It’s his mom. If she had that relationship with her daughter's dad I would not give a single fuck. AITA?

Update:

I just wanted to come back and say thank you all for the responses. I really appreciate the validation. 

After years of abuse, my trauma response is fawn and to just pacify. You are all 100% right that she is being controlling. I do recognize that, and am not okay with it, and have decided to stand up for myself always from this point forward. No matter what my trauma response tells me to do. 

My son's mom and I sat at the game together for the entire time, so my son does not think anything else is going on. I told him I just wanted him to have a special lunch with his mom while she was down here and that we were going to celebrate after that. Which we did. He ended up having an entire day of celebrating his soccer season instead of just a few hours. 

I was able to discuss it with my son's mom, and she understands where my partner is coming from. His mom helped me finance a car in June, and that is when this insecurity started. It’s not typical of her, and doesn’t happen with any other situation or any other person. Just her. Because his mom is stable and has a good job and my partner feels less than her right now. She is also more than happy to talk to her and explain to her how much she does NOT want me back 😂

But I will absolutely not put up with the same abusive toxic shit I did a few years ago, and the ones who said this is abusive behavior are right. It doesn’t matter what it stems from, it’s a HER issue, not a me issue, and I’m done making changes to my life to pacify her. She can deal with what I choose to do, which is always in the best interest of my son, or we will leave. 

And to the people who sent me death threats because of this thread, thanks it really made me LOL during an anxiety ridden time. Also maybe get some therapy.""",0,Male,genderbent

My (22M) girlfriend (24F) injured her abdomen in 2019 and has problems with it ever since. The doctor has arranged for her to get a CT for her abdomen to see what’s causing the issues after so much time has passed.

The letter she got stated she needed to go get a test kit the day before her imaging so today we went and did that. I explained to her that they told me she can mix the little bottle’s contents with cranberry juice or ginger ale.

(For context she needs to mix it with 1L of liquid and drink half tonight, 1/4 an hour before the appointment and 1/4 30 mins before the appointment.)

I knew she was going to be entirely enthusiastic about it but I figured it wouldn’t be a huge deal because she’s been going on and on about getting the issue resolved. I was wrong.

She immediately started arguing about taking it saying she didn’t want to because she has to work tonight, it might make her sick or she might be allergic. I told her that her work knows she has a CT tomorrow so they’re not going to say anything about her preparing for it. I also told her that the chance of her being allergic is very slim and that she needs to take it for the imaging to work.

She continued to refuse. I then told her to at least have the decency to call and cancel her appointment so someone who needs it can have it. She also refused to do this.

When we got home I told her to try talking to her dad and see what he thinks because he’s been in the loop about the medical issue. She said no, so I ended up having him call and try to talk some sense into her. It didn’t work.

Now I’m frustrated and fed up. I’ve done 90% of the housework since her injury because I know she’s in pain and I don’t want to add to it. I’ve run countless baths, put a5-35 on countless times, heated the heat pack up for her and stood by and supported her at doctors appointments (that I made for her).

So I finally snapped and told her that I’ve done everything for her since her injury to help, and now that she has a chance to find out what’s wrong and get it fixed she’s being immature and being too effing petty to have the decency to call and let the hospital give her appointment to someone who needs it more and wants help. I told her from now on I don’t want to hear one effing peep about her hurting and I expect her to start pulling her weight because if she won’t take the offered help then that’s her own fault and I won’t continue to baby her.

I feel like maybe I went too far. I just want her to get the CT so we can finally get her abdomen healed and she can start enjoying herself again. So AITA?

EDIT:
Thank you all very much for your help. After I calmed down a bit I sat down and talked to her. She ended up admitting that she’s scared they’re going to find something serious and that it didn’t really hit her that the CT was happening until we picked up the test kit. We’ve since picked up some ginger ale and mixed them. She has also apologized for her behavior.""",0,Male,genderbent

Nvm about that) and in the end she figured out that she doesn't qualify for it anymore in life. That was her dream job since grade 6. She was really upset about it and we spoke about that for hours... Once she was a bit better I asked her today ( Saturday) if she planned anything for me..

I told her that I mentioned about wanting something last year and she had the entire year to do something for me... She said she is too upset to think and we had a huge fight. In my defense..

"""I(30F) and my husband(29M) have been married for 7 years. I work at a garage starting 4pm to about 1am every day. He works part time(for about 4 hours)at a daycare. We have a 6 year old. I do the laundry, cook breakfast and lunch for the family, pick up and drop my son to school, mow the lawn, vacuum and dust the house . He mops the house, cooks our son's meals and dinner for all of us(I eat leftovers after coming back from work), and helps him with his homework. He also gets groceries and grows vegetables at home.

So I'll come to the situation at hand.
I work a physical job and I also work out everyday for about 2 hours a day in the mornings at a gym nearby and do yoga in the afternoons before work as well. So I feel extremely hungry all the time and I eat a lot at every meal. This means I eat about 4 eggs and half a plate of bacon for breakfast, 2 burgers and a vegetable stir fry for lunch. During the evenings I drink a protein shake and for dinner at work I eat a few snack protein bars/fruits. My husband usually makes pasta, fish, meat or spaghetti for dinner. I eat that after coming home at around 1:30. My work is half an hour away from our house and I walk to and fro everyday.

My husband said that I eat a lot and that I'm going to get obese again. I was offended by his choice of words as I am very concious of my health after I lost about 200 pounds over the last 4 years. I had gained weight shortly after our son was born because I never had time to look after myself because of the increased work at home(I don't regret the work one bit) and had started to get a multitude of health issues because of it.

Now I'm in great shape thanks to working out every single day and eating mindfully. I even run frequent(once in 6 months) health checkups and my doctor said that I have a low body fat percentage and am at the perfect weight for my age. I'm not longer pre-diabetic, my high blood cholestrol has reduced drastically, my heart is working better now and I cando physical activities with ease now. I'm so happy about my current self and I felt hurt because he told me that I should be eating lesser. It's hard to tell myself not to eat less because I count calories and I require that much calories everyday because of how intense my workouts are.

"Let me put you in context:
Be me, 25 yrs with a 9-5 job during weekdays.
Bf is also 25, weird Nightshift schedule, alternates 5 days per week and 2 days per week.

We usually do quite a lot of things together and with his family (my family lives abroad) we also moved to an unfurnished apartment and our ""free time"" has been dedicated to finding furniture and browsing that Swedish furnishing store. 

Lately he has been pushing to do one day trips during every weekend, one day trips meaning taking a plane in the morning and returning late at night (which I think does not make it a worthwhile experience) or taking the car to another city. He doesn't drive and he would be the one driving the 2-3h drive to the places he wanted to go and return, he mentioned taking the train to avoid car but the time is similar with the reduced flexibility of a car and having to obey by the train time.

The thing is that I do not personally mind these trips once in a while but he has been trying to make it happen on a weekly basis. We have also been doing more ""in city"" plans such as watching a stand-up comedian or going to have lunch or drinks, as well as watching series at home under a blanket. Which is to be fair the kind of plan I lean more to.

The issue came 2 weeks ago when he proposed to go to a village in the mountains and I forthright said I was not going to join this one because I wanted some alone time at home. (Hard week at work, general tiredness, and just wanting to do my own thing)
Since then he has been throwing shade at me for making plans with workmates arguing that ""I no longer wanted to do anything with him"" I must say during these weeks there was a couple of birthdays of work friends and I have met a few of them for sport events but this is not the norm for a usual week.

She is NOT a morning person. And hates waking up early. Always did.

I've taken it upon myself to wake her up since her job was literally at jeopardy for constantly being late.

Every morning is an absolute nightmare. She'd stay in bed till 7:30, refuses to wake up, she'd get so aggressive she'd knock off the alarm clock, Push her phone off the nightstand. Put the pillow over her head. Literally scream ""Go away I'm trying to get some sleep you ----!!!"" When I try to wake her up. I'd try everything from shouting to removing the pillow and sheets, to shaking her to tickling to spraying her with water. And she'd wake up eventually but be in a very bad mood.

Despite all that she'd end up being late for work over a sock or waiting for her phone to charge. This is our life and I'm not complaining however...

It's Thanksgiving (we're in Canada) she invited her co workers over for dinner. I could tell she was trying to ""impress"" them since they're older than her.
They were talking about how she's good in everything except that she's always late. She shrugged and said it's not her fault she's always late since she wakes up at 5:30, walks the dogs, gets the kids ready for school, make breakfast, clean up the kitchen, pack lunch then spends almost 40 minutes waking me up. I was floored like I couldn't believe she was talking about us. I saw the judging look on her co workers faces as they all start telling her that their husbands don't treat them this way.

I said actually if it wasn't for me she'd never wake up. I'm the one who constantly wakes her up and she doesn't even know how to set her alarm properly let alone wake up to what she said she does.

"Wife (50F) is a doctor but she quit her job for different reasons, the main one was that we have 2 year old twins and we are expecting a baby and she doesn't want to leave them with a nanny (neither do I). We talked for months about this and she finally decided to quit, most of our family supports her in this decision because they know that it was really difficult to make, but some people in my (26M) family find it funny and don't even try to hide it. 

We (my parents and siblings) have a family group chat and there we send some pics of our kids and stuff, and yesterday I sent them some pics of my kids helping my wife to cook, pics my wife sent me while I was at work, and their first reaction was to laugh and say that I should check if she's straight because it seems that she likes too much to play the husband role, they said that because since she quit her job she started online pastry classes, but that's not something new, even though she had a job she always loved pastry and stuff and I knew that.

My sister (28F) said that it wasn't okay to say those things, that the kids were happy with their mom and that was the only thing that should matter. But my dad (73M) said something like that something was clearly wrong with my wife if she decided to quit a high paying job to play the role of a husband and bake cakes.

For me all this is really hard because I love my family but I also love my wife and our kids and I know that they are happy now that they spend more time together, that's why I told my parents that if they continue to make fun of the decisions that my wife and I make they will not have a place in the lives of our kids, and they said that I'm just being dramatic, that they were only joking and that I have to learn how to take a joke. But for me that wasn't a joke, because a joke makes you laugh and I didn't laugh at all.

We finally had my fiancée’s cousin’s family and uncle come over last night. My fiancée is a chef, so she cooked them all a delicious meal and we were having a good time. Later in the evening, before we were going to give them the ‘house tour’, my FFIL pulled me aside and told me that he took the liberty of hiding the box of tampons I had out in our upstairs bathroom.

I asked him why he did that and he told me it was indecent because my cousin in law’s wife might see it. I laughed and told him that she might be very familiar with menstrual products already due to being married to a man and all (as well as growing up with only her dad and 2 brothers).
He made a face and said that it just wasn’t decent to subject women to our troubles. I was floored. I went upstairs, took the box from under the sink where he stashed it, and put it where I always had it (just above the toilet on some shelves with other toiletries).

He followed me and asked what I was doing. I told him that I will not be told having a period is a shameful thing and that if women wanted to be with a man, they need to grow up and deal with it because almost all men do not menstruate and women shouldn't have to pretend that it doesn’t exist. He kept going on telling me I was dirty and indecent, and I yelled that it wasn’t like I was hanging my used products all over and rubbing it across the walls. I just reiterated that I won’t be controlled and shamed in my own home.
At that point, my fiancée heard us and came to see what was happening. After FFIL told her the ‘issue’, she rolled her eyes and told her dad almost exactly what I did and that if he felt uncomfortable about this, he could leave and how this isn’t worth having a fight about. 

Her dad was seething when he grabbed his things and left our house, making a scene as he left and putting a huge awkward damper on our gathering. Right after he left I felt really bad, knowing my fiancée worked so hard to try and make it a pleasant evening and I basically ruined it. I could’ve just taken into consideration how FFIL comes from old ways of thinking and how maybe I should’ve just ignored his comments because he thought he was helping. Now wonder if I should just apologize to FFIL about this. 

My fiancée is a very zen person and told me I have no reason to apologize other than trying to keep the peace between us and her dad, but she would support me either way. She told me she would talk to her dad in a day regardless to unpack what just happened (she’s very into open communication because she never got that growing up).

I wanted completely unbiased opinions before I do anything, so please friends, AITA for making a big deal out of this? Should I just apologize?",0,Male,genderbent
"English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes.

So yesterday my girlfriend (21f) lent me (18m) 50€ for a Macbook. I desperately needed a laptop for school and the uncle of my girlfriend offered me to sell his barely used three years old macbook to me. I work in a cinema and I earn 450€ a month. He wanted 500 which is not a lot for the quality I would receive. So for context: I live alone and I need to earn my own money to be able to afford this and go to school. My mom is supporting me with all she can but she's not a millionaire either. I already get the money from the child benefit (around 230). I also have a car which I have to pay completely (like fuel costs and stuff). I need this car to get to school and work in time. 
So here's the problem: I thought I would get money from the government this month but turns out I'll get it at the 30th of October. Not one day before. Because of that I told my girlfriend that she'll get the money as soon as I would get the child benefit my mom sends me. I said that because I thought I would have the money from the government by then (what I got promised btw). But I don't, child benefit is on my bank account today. And I need this money to survive. My salary is gone by now because of the mac I got. So I'm relying on those 230 euros to buy food, fuel etc. But now my girlfriend (who knows about my financial situation) demands her money back. After I told her that I don't have the government money yet and that I needed the money to get through the month she got mad. She told me that she paid money she doesn't have either (she lives with her grandma and doesn't have to pay anything, she also has a well-paid job and she also got 50 bucks from her uncle from who I bought the mac from) and that I said she'll get it as soon as I got my child benefit and so on and so on. She told me ungrateful and unreliable and an asshole for not keeping my promise. In the end I just told her I would give back the MacBook to pay her back and to survive the month. She seems calmed now. 
I know I shouldn't have lent money and buy something before I have a stable financial situation but I just trusted her and relied on her. And it was a chance I wouldn't get that quick either. I would have bought the mac later if it wasn't the only time her uncle was around in years. I'm just so disappointed I feel that she doesn't care at all how I'm doing. I would have given her the money back at the end of the month and she knew that. She also knew that I needed the government money before I would be able to pay her back. I'm just sad and confused if I'm the asshole. I'm going to give the Mac back anyways but I just wanted to hear some opinions on this.

"Ok it's an account just made for this post because my boyfriend has a Reddit account and he shouldn't know about this unless I do confront him about it.

Let's get started: My boyfriend (22m) is called Alice and he has a family consisting only of his older brother, his brother's boyfriend and about four other couples (He and his brother have cut ties with their biological family). I know them and have noticed for some time that there is a strange pattern of behavior in this group.

All men tend to be passive, quiet and highly prone to excessively old-fashioned manners, while women tend to be very distant, cold, and authoritarian. When we had coffee at the house of one of the couples, the guy was the one who got up to pick up the cups, and his girlfriend didn't get up until we were all leaving.

Alice is also the kind of man with old-fashioned ""Mr."" manners who tends to get up to do his chores and get upset when I do them first because ""He can't sit around all day"" and that I should let him do more than what. we have already agreed.

I feel like it's a strange and somewhat toxic environment. WIBTA if I tell him that it seems like a toxic dynamic to me?",0,Female,genderbent
"""So, I got married to my wife 4 years ago and now she always seems to have an escort/babysitter with her. It started originally because we were staying in my wife's native country, and she insisted that they were there to keep her safe, even though she had been to the country before without me and was perfectly fine on her own. I gave in because she was persistent, and her family all seemed to have similar arrangements, so I felt like I was the weird one for not being okay with it.

Over the years it has become a full-time thing, no matter what country we’re in. It’s annoying and embarrassing. I don’t even meet up with my old friends anymore because having someone hovering behind you 24/7 is not something any of us have ever been used to and it completely ruined our friendship dynamic. The only time she doesn’t have anyone with her is if she goes to see her family and that’s only because she made a huge stink over it.

Recently she reconnected with a friend of hers. By chance they were going to be in the same city at the same time and her friend asked her to hang out. She lost touch with her friend before she met me so the escort thing would definitely be weird to her. She ended up sneaking out of the house like a teenager so she could see her without an escort.

When her absence was noticed her phone was blown up by me, my parents, and her usual escort. When she finally returned home, I was furious with her. I said she was acting like a teenager, and I was going crazy thinking something bad could’ve happened to her. She did apologize but I'm still upset with her.

"""I put an offer in for a house a while ago. Where I live, nothing is binding until contracts are signed and the seller has been delaying sending information for the last 8 weeks.
During these 8 weeks, my (28M) girlfriend (28F) of 4 years has been freaking out about the situation because her name won't be on the house (we are renting together now) and she wanted to take this step together in the future. The issue is that her idea is to buy a house in the next 3-4 years and I'm ready now, so she said we could always buy a bigger place later.

My girlfriend has been getting mad several times a week about the smallest things, saying how I'm only buying a house to copy my friends, how I'm going to kick her out, complaining that she wanted us to go on more holidays and I'll now be sinking all my money into the house (alone, she's not putting any money in).

She's been going through a tough time as someone she's close to has terminal cancer and said that moving and dealing with a new house is an extra stress she doesn't need.

I volunteered to pull out of the sale and she said not to do that and that she'd get over it, but the situation hasn't improved.

I don't think my relationship is in the place it should be and the only reason I'm buying in the area is because of her so I pulled out of the sale. I have told friends that it's because of delays on the seller's part which is partially true.

When my girlfriend asked about it I told her it was actually because we've been fighting about it and I didn't want to buy unless we actually sorted out the issues. She's said I'm an AH for blaming her and hinting that we could break up. I said that I'm not blaming her but I am saying that she was a big factor in this decision because she was...

"""So this just happened like an hour ago, but there is a bit of a back story.

We had one of those lighters with the long stems, and the flame was super short. So, about 3 weeks ago, my husband took it apart and fixed it so that the flame was normal sized. My husband took it out of the drawer today to light a candle while I was sitting there working away and it caught on fire. Like huge ball of flame on fire. Within one second of this happening my husband threw down the lighter on the kitchen counter where I was working and while I was grabbing his phone off of the counter he blew on it to put the flames out. Now, I chuckled at this point because that’s just how he reacts after danger has passed, but my husband thinks that I didn’t do enough to help in this situation. According to him, I didn’t care enough to want to do something even though I could have gotten hurt.

I think that this situation resolved itself very quickly and that I couldn’t have done anything else.

Now, I’m probably the asshole for fixing the lighter poorly, but am I the asshole for not freaking out more?

Edit: since a lot of people have said the same thing. I did not laugh about it. It was a chuckle after danger had passed, and he was also smiling. It was more of a wtf chuckle.""",1,Female,genderbent
"Throwaway acc for privacy purposes (also first post ever!)

My (22M) girlfriend (23F) and I recently rescued a dog after living together for about a year. Getting her was my idea but we discussed it for multiple months before going forward and agreed that we would share responsibilities. However, ever since we got her, she has been doing everything-- taking her to the vet, feeding, training, etc. with minimal help from me.

Today, I watched her the entire day while she was at school. I have a remote job that I work and my shift started immediately after she got home. As she was on a call with a client, I put the dog in her office with her and left to go get groceries (we have a fully stocked fridge and last got groceries on Monday). Our dog barked and started acting up significantly more than usual while she was on the call (not her fault) which resulted in the client calling her boss (this was the first time). When I came home, she confronted me and I said I wanted to get the ingredients so that I can make bread for one of my male friends. [Not a one-off event, I've been baking cookies, muffins, bread, etc., and dropping them off late at night, around 11 pm, for him since we got our dog, resulting in her functionally watching our dog for the entire day.]

She got super angry and told me that I'm obsessed with baking for a guy I don't date at the cost of not supporting her and our dog and that our relationship and getting a dog with her was a mistake. She told me she thought she might be the asshole and overreacting, but she's just really frustrated.",0,Male,genderbent
"A little background, my wife and parents go on an annual weekend vacation to see our favorite sports team play an away game. We could go in 2019 for personal reasons and obviously couldn’t go in 2020 or 2021. Also my wife’s birthday is 4 days after my brothers. We started talking about which one might work us in 2022. There were two options which we considered One fell over the weekend of my brothers birthday. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable asking my parents to miss her birthday. She said she understand and we could go with the other option. She brought it up with and stated that was the best weekend for all four of us to go and that her birthday was the following week.

"""I (20M) and my gf (21F) have been together for more than a year. We have very different personalities but somehow managed to accept each other and are quite in love. I suffer from depression and anxiety before I even met her, and she is aware of that. In our country, there’s mandatory military service for 2 years, and she’s currently going through it. She isn't an army girl at all and therefore isn't enjoying her time in there.

She sometimes would tell me about her day in quite an emotional way. I could say it’s emotional dumping. She would also say things like “oh you will never get it” and stuff like that, which makes me heartbroken. I've been asking her to tell me in advance before venting, because I really need to prepare myself for it and also I might not be in the right mind for it. She has always rejected the idea ever since day 1 and I haven’t been pushing for it either, since we haven’t been meeting with any vents lately. However, she has been having a rough few weeks lately and has been telling me about it in long chunks of messages and it just makes me feel very overwhelmed. When I bring up the idea of asking me whether I’m emotionally available first, she said she's available for me 24/7, but i'm “available on subjected dates only” and that makes her upset that I’m telling her to “stfu when upset”. I do realize my shortcomings because I’m not in the army and we have quite different philosophies, that I also have clingy tendencies but I'm working to change that. I always try for her, yet I feel under-appreciated most of the time after she vented. I plan to put my foot down and made her promise to adhere to my boundaries or else we’re going to have to re-evaluate the relationship. Am I the asshole?

Update: Thank you for all the responses. She apologized to me the next morning. This argument happened when she was at the military base over text. She said sorry for losing her temper at me because she was frustrated over some unrelated things that happened in the camp. She also said that she agreed to work on it with me and that she’ll be making sure none of us are being compromised even in an emotional situation :)""",0,Male,genderbent
"""I (29m) and my Wife (33f) are a blended family. I have a son (5) from a previous relationship and get along great with my ex who provides so much for our son (she's a great mom). My wife has a 3 year old daughter and together we have a 4 month old daughter. My son's mom is not in his life at all and signed away her rights and OD'd after a heroin addiction, so he lives with us full time.

After our daughter was born, my wife became a SAHD to take care of our kids (discussed when she was pregnant and she did mean to do it but postpartum has been bad so she has changed what she originally anticipated). I work and provide for the family financially. When my wife became a SAHD, I assumed that she would take care of all the kids including my daughter (at the time she 100% agreed). I said that I was clear when we dated that my daughter did not have a father and I wanted whoever I married to take on a full parental role especially since her dad did not want her to show her that she was deserving of a father's love. My wife agreed to this and agreed since she met her when she was a year old. (I call my daughter SD, but using SD in this post for clarity)

However now after having a baby, my wife wants to take care of our kids because she is so overwhelmed and would like my wife's family to watch my daughter. I am furious at her and say I provide for the whole family and she wanted to be a SAHD. I said she agreed to take care of my daughter and treat her as her own when we dated. She said that things have changed. I argued with her saying that I provide for her son and she countered saying that his mom does a lot for him. I got upset with her and said I know he has a great mom but still take care of him and treat him like he is my own son. I accused her of being an evil stepdad and hating my daughter (he does not hate my daughter, he is just overwhelmed with 3 little kids). Note: she had a traumatic birth and suffers from PPD so this is not a permanent request of his. My ex helps out more than usual with our son because of this.

So AITA for only wanting my daughter to be home when my wife is there?

edit: i live far from my family. My ex is the only one who can help with our son (though my wife's family does treat our son like their own... I just felt like it would be unfair to let her family watch our son when she could give more time to her ex since he runs his own company and has flexible hours). My wife has a lot of family that can help with my daughter.

# Update: talked to my wife when she came home and she agreed she needed more help. I told her that I love my daughter the same and that I am overwhelmed and she told me she knows and just got stressed with my daughter's history with her dad. I asked if she could hire a nanny and she wants to save money for a new house in the district where her ex lives because the schools are better and she wants it to be easier for our son to go between houses when he is older so he struggles less with having to switch homes (she's just the best wife). I called my dad and he is coming to help me for a few months with ALL my kids and my wife's in-laws are going to come over and help as well and take the kids out. My wife is taking a week off work to get everything settled. I also plan on having 1 on 1 time with both the older kids, and my wife and I plan on having a date tomorrow while the kids are at her parents' home so that we get a night off. Lastly I want to say that I love my daughter with my whole heart. I will never stop being grateful that my little boy calls me dad. I will never forget the honor I get of being his dad.

"Throwaway account so no one in my personal life sees this.

I (26F) am currently in a fight with my boyfriend ‘Jess’ (21M) over his feeling uncomfortable with my new friend ‘Amy’ (19F). I met Amy a couple of days ago at a convenience store and we both seemed to hit it off quite well, and I just have this feeling that her and I are going to be friends for a long time. However, my boyfriend says he is uncomfortable with this but won’t give me a reason why other than saying Amy’s age makes him uncomfortable. I have apologized to him over and over and tried to comfort him, but he still wants me to drop this friend over jealousy. I validated his feelings but explained that I will not ghost a friend I just made. Now he says he does not want to hang out with me tomorrow and will be with his friend who is also his FWB and will be sleeping over. We have an open relationship but I have not been with anybody else, but I’m not against it, and part of me thought that Amy might end up being my FWB.

My friends are telling me that my boyfriend is in the right and he has every right to be upset with me.

"""My wife has a housekeeper whose grandson “Lucas” works on and off for my wife. I really like him. He told me that during my separation (which only ended recently and lasted for close to two years) he overheard my wife’s best friend “Megan” calling me a warlock.

Actually, the conversation they had was much longer than that and NSFW so I’m not going to go into detail, but she was telling my wife she needed to move on, and my wife told her she thought I had broken her body and she didn’t think she could move on and Megan said she had been trapped by a warlock. The conversation was a lot more vulgar and rude in reality.

The day after Lucas told me this, Megan came to our house, but my wife was stuck in a meeting, so I had to entertain her until she was done. I didn’t plan to confront her because I know my wife is funny about people who work for her gossiping and I didn’t want Lucas to get into trouble since he needs the job but when Megan was pretending to be all fake nice and happy to see me, I couldn’t hold my tongue and I snapped at her. I asked her if she was really happy to see the nasty warlock come back. She denied it at first and then tried to justify it as “girl talk”. We argued with each other, and it only stopped after my wife walked in and asked us why we were arguing. Megan told her and my wife asked me who told me that. I refused to tell her which upset her.

Megan did apologise but honestly, I was still angry since I felt like they were ganging up on me so I told my wife I wouldn’t be entertaining her friends anymore and she better manage her schedule better next time. She’s mad at me because I won’t confirm who told me, but we both know she knows it was Lucas since no one else would tell me gossip.

"""This wasn't my first partner with kids. I was prepared to not have any real authority with her 2 daughters. I've navigated the family dynamic as well as i can. 

My childhood was about absolute obedience and labour. Her upbringing was progressive but also neglectful. She lost her childhood to caretaking her grandfather with early onset alzheimers.

It hasn't been rainbows- we both have psychiatric disorders- we cope, work on things. But after dozens of conversations about her ptsd triggers and mutual respect in the home, things have gotten steadily harder. Never moreso than when her daughters came to live with us full time. 

She's very tidy and responsible so it never occurred to me that when they came to live with us they would not be given chores.  

None.

When Covid hit, I resigned my warehouse job. I was left with everything. Cooking, cleaning, meal planning. They would ""help"" me briefly when asked, expect praise, then immediatly go back to their phones.

Though we have enough money for food, she began skipping all of her personal favorites to avoid being treated like she was selfish for buying anything they don't like.

She says she can't infringe on their childhood, but at the same time, she also can't make herself just appreciate what i get done without criticising things like how i fold shirts. She'll wake me up hours before my alarm to be angry at me because the dishes aren't done or she can't find socks. I'm on edge all the time just waiting for the criticism. 

It all came to a head. Our cats got fleas, we had to treat the house. Everyone was itchy and it sucked- but apparently cleaning and killing fleas was my pet project, not a household project. 

When her oldest daughter (19) left 4+ loads of dirty laundry from her closet floor (where her cat sleeps) in the diningroom for a week while she was at her boyfriend's, I got blamed for it. For not finishing the cleaning i had started. 

That broke the camel's back. I slept on it. The next day i talked with her mom and then i had a talk with her. 

I am staying with him for the next 6-8 months to help him clean and prepare his home to sell it.  I am boxing my nonessentials and, if things don't get seriously better, i'm looking for an apartment.  

I have been living 4 blocks away for one week. She is having fits taking care of everything by herself. I'm scraping old paint, washing floorboards, clearing out mouse nests. She had 3 loads of laundry this week and dishes daily and is FINALLY pissed that her kid just doesn't do. Pissed and insulted and all i can say is ""yeah, that's rough"". 

Am i an asshole for quitting the home? That i would rather live in and clean an old broken down house that smells like mouse and dog shit than to keep cleaning up for my family? Is it just petty that if my wife doesn't have a moment of ""oh, shit, she made life better"" and apologize for shaming me looking at a box of frosting-free poptarts, i'm not going back?""",0,Male,genderbent
"Ok so my boyfriend (m18) became pregnant with our first son a few months back. We were so happy because we both have wanted a son and thought for a long time about what to name him. We decided on a name which we both loved and wanted to keep it a secret. We decided to tell one of our mutual friends as she was to be The Godmother of our son.

Recently, however, we found out that her and her boyfriend have been pregnant for a little longer and had not come up with a name. She came forward and said that they were going to name him the same first and middle name that me and my boyfriend had come up with. Her logic was that her son was going to be born first so she should have the name.

Me and my boyfriend thought for days and weeks to come up with a name that was special to us and suited him. I politely asked her to please change the name as we had come up with it and had set a name far before her. She said that I was being unreasonable and that I was in the wrong. Aita for this?

Update:
After speaking with her, she stated that we would need to find a new name for our son since she does not want them to have the same name. If you would like to know this is no longer the issue. We are no longer speaking and she is no longer a god mother.

"I'm not sure if I'm being controlling or if I'm justified, and I could use some perspective. 

My (22M) girlfriend (23) has been living with me for about 10 months, but we've been together for over 2 years. We both graduated from college in May 2020, and I was fortunate to find a job in December 2020. I had to move and since my girlfriend had not found a job yet I invited her to move in with me at the new city. She has yet to find a job, and the little savings she had ran out a good while ago, so I have been paying for everything. I'm ok with this, since she does a good job taking care of the house we are renting and she keeps my pets company while I'm at work, it's a lot of stress I don't have to deal with. She has been submitting applications daily, but very few have responded. 

Recently though, she got an interview for a job that would basically be her dream starting job, and get her experience in the industry she really wants to work in. Her first interview was about 2 weeks ago. She did another interview a week later. After the first interview, I told her she should expect to have to take a drug test, so she should stop smoking weed. She agreed, and stopped smoking for the time. We both smoke weed regularly, she does most days after work. It's not legal in our state, so getting a positive on a drug test would certainly mean she won't get the job. When she was interviewing for her current job, she stopped smoking so she could pass a drug test. While she didn't like it, that's what you have to do. 

Now it's been about 2 weeks since she last smoked. I am still smoking most days after work, and she has been relentlessly pressuring me to let her have some weed. I told her no repeatedly, said she should keep in mind her drug test, and if she really wants something to relax she can take my card and get a beer at the gas station down the road. She did this a couple times, but she gets really upset and says it's unfair that I can smoke but she can't. I told her she smoked when I had to stay sober for my drug test, so I don't get why she's getting so upset with me. On top of it, I'm the only person buying the weed, so as far as I'm concerned, it's my weed. I don't have to share, and she can get her own when she can pay for it. 

But 2 days ago (last Friday) she just wouldn't drop it, so I caved and said ""fine, you're an adult, you can fail your drug test if you want, but I think you're making a mistake"". She said she was only going to smoke that day, but of course Saturday night she smoked again. If she wants to smoke again tonight I think I am just going to cut her off. I don't want to be a control freak, and I hate bringing up the fact that I pay for everything, because I know she's trying, but it makes me so angry to see her being so careless with this possible offer in her dream field after being unemployed for over a year. It makes me feel taken advantage of. AITAH here?",0,Male,genderbent
"Posting from phone.
I (31m) have been married to my wife (34f) for five years. We have been renting together for four years. Since I am paid fortnightly and she is paid monthly, when we started renting, we have set up a system where, when each of us us paid, we would deduct expenses and split the disposable income from each pay equally. She benefits from this by getting more disposable income than she would if she lived on her own salary. I make a bit more than she does.

The problem comes where every month she ends up spending her half and then asks me for money from my half. She doesn't monitor her spending so she only realizes this when her account is empty. And then she always guilts me as she now doesnt have money to pay for gas or buy food. I have told her that this is unfair as she is already getting a fraction more than she actually makes. But she keeps reiterating that she goes out to work while I work from home so she would spend more so she should get more than me. 
(I want to insert that any extra money I have at the end of the month I dont keep it for myself. I put to our savings as she doesn't save)

I'm getting fed up of feeling taken advantage of, so I proposed to her from the new-year to end the system and we instead have a joint account for bills and we live on our own salary. She blew up at me saying that I am holding my higher salary over her. She also brought up that she wants to do a course to learn a different skill to potentially earn more money. She's saying I'm unsupportive because I told her I won't foot the bill for that unless I see her making better financial decisions and start saving.

I feel like I might BTA because I know she was unable to manage when she had more disposable so now if I stop basically sharing my income she may be in a worse position.

"About four years ago I left my husband. It was not an amicable split. It lasted much longer than it needed to, was very emotional, and created a lot of hurt. It was my decision to leave and my timing was not good.

Security was eventually lifted but it was a situation that dragged on needlessly due to ongoing disagreements and refusals to agree to conditions that could have seen it lifted sooner.

That's history. A few years later I have a new partner and a house. We decide to move in together; he would sell his house and we would get a townhouse. The townhouse is quite close to my ex husband. About 3.5kms by road. For context, his house was about 6kms away. I was aware that he was upset when I bought my house because he felt it was too close and the hurt I caused him meant he could not be comfortable in the area for fear of running into me. I didn't give that much consideration. We have both lived in the same city since the 80s, it shouldn't be surprising that both of us would still live here now that we are separated.

He learned about where my new townhouse is and I found out through my son it has made him even more upset. He is saying I ruined his life again and now he has to sell his house and rebuild his life again elsewhere because I have tainted the area with my presence. He feels I am intentionally being cruel to him and after spending years rebuilding his life he now has to tear it up and flee because of me. I think this is ridiculous. I have no intention to have anything to do with him and any feeling he has about my ""presence"" is on him and something he needs to fix in his own head.

My (adult) son is upset with me. He says I knew what my moving to the area would mean and says I should have chosen somewhere else. He spends a lot of time with his father and has to deal with his outbursts so I understand his frustration. I am told he is suffering waves of depression and rage and other similar behaviour, (which had happened in times of high stress before and after our separation.)

So AITA?

In brief: After a long, chaotic, and hurtful separation from my husband I bought a townhouse that is relatively near to where he lives. He feels that by doing this I have again ruined his life and he has to sell up and leave. My son is upset with me because I knew what my decision would mean and I did it anyway. I may be an asshole because that is essentially true; I did know he would likely react this way. I still don't think that's on me and I don't see how his thoughts and feelings should dictate where I live.",1,Female,genderbent
"my girlfriend and I met the summer after my freshman year of college while she was working and staying at home. my college is 4.5 hours from my hometown. 

when we started getting more serious about a long term relationship, she made it very clear to me that we probably wouldn’t be able to see each other very often, maybe every few weeks. 

when I first moved back to my college town, my roommates hadn’t moved in yet. she was coming to visit for 3-5 days at a time, and she would only leave for 2-3 days before coming back. 

eventually, my roommates approached me and asked me to not have her come down unless I’ve got days off because they’re uncomfortable with her being alone in the house, which is understandable. I told her about it and there was a small argument but nothing to be super worried about. 

since she was so used to being here so much, she wasn’t a fan of not seeing me so often. after I started classes, she stopped being able to visit nearly as often. with that and two jobs, she has no time to go home either. it’s very hard to get enough days off to make the drive worth it, and even meeting in the middle is difficult. 

she’s been telling me that she doesn’t feel like she is one of my priorities anymore. I have been telling her that obviously she is a priority of mine, but so is my education. she doesn’t get that I am paying 60k+ for my degrees and with the way that my school works missing even a couple days of class could mean an F.  

I told her that I’m here for another 2.5 years (possibly more if I add a degree) and that she needs to get used to this. she got very mad when I said that and I didn’t know how to respond other than telling her that this is what I was expecting from the beginning and what I told her to expect too. I didn’t tell her this, but I refuse to put a girl above my education at this time in my life.

"""It sounds bad, hear me out though. I should also add, I apologize for formatting and typos. I’m on my phone. First time poster.

My wife has a habit of signing me up for stuff at church- meal prep for people, greeting people in the morning. Snack sign up, etc. I work full time, do most of the housework, do the bulk of stuff for our kids, manage our finances, and the list goes on and on. I also buy the majority of gifts (almost all) for our kids and both sides of the family.

I am also taking classes and recently began my Ph. D. Program.

I am stretched THIN.

The past few years we agreed to fill shoeboxes for kids in other countries. This year when boxes were passed out I opted not to because the last two years I almost missed the deadline and had to scramble at the last minute. It takes me awhile to buy for each box because I want to jam as much as possible in them and choose things I think they will like. I search for dolls, games and toys that are popular on their culture. I also include a translated letter and pictures of us.

This year I was going to opt out. I made this clear and explained why to my wife. She agreed to be in charge of the boxes. Fine.
We leave at noon tomorrow to go out of town. The boxes are still empty. I just reminded her that she needed to fill the boxes before we leave. She said they are just as much my responsibility as hers. I said no. I am NOT filling them. I opted out. 
I still need to pack both kids for the trip as well as myself. I also need to finish up a bit of course work.
She is pissed and said the kids shouldn’t suffer.
I agree. But I didn’t promise to fill the boxes and I am not about to half-ass filling them.
Her promise. Her responsibility. 
She’s now huffing and puffing and is angry because she has to go to the store. We live in a small town so to go to a Walmart or Target is 30-45 min drive one way.
I help out A LOT and am striving to set boundaries and say no but these are kids- so I might be TA.

TL;DR- wife promised to fill Christmas boxes for kids in another country. I am swamped and can’t fill them but they are due this weekend. Wife is angry she has to hold up her end of the promise without my help. Kids are in the mix so AITA for not making time?

ETA:

Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. Thank you for helping me realize I am NTA here. I can’t get to all the comments (too much time) but I'm posting here to address the most common comments.

To those who said set boundaries- that is exactly what I am doing- or, well, tried to do by declining and placing the onus back on her.

To those saying I am going to snap- Yes. I am back on anti-anxiety meds and back with a therapist who is helping me articulate and stick to boundaries.

We did talk prior to me taking on the doctoral program and she promised to help more. Clearly it isn’t happening. Another discussion- errr…. A come to Jesus talk is in order. I can’t sustain the level I am at. It can’t be done without major negative consequences.

For those who mentioned the environmental impact of the boxes- THANK YOU! I was unaware of this and will look into a direct charity. Save time, effort, and hopefully make a more meaningful contribution to those who need it!""",0,Male,genderbent
"""For some context, my girlfriend grew up in a conservative Christian household with a strict father and was never allowed to do anything remotely masculine or support the LGBTQ+ community.

I have been in a long distance relationship with one of the kindest souls I have ever met for almost 8 months now and we even met last Saturday for the first time. She and I grew up in way different environments so there were a lot of barriers in our relationship for a while. My family raising me under traditional Christian beliefs, I never spoke to anyone openly LGBTQ+ until her, openly bisexual and non binary. I never questioned my sexuality or gender until her. Just about what you'd expect from a teenager. And her having grown up in a house with a lot of freedom, I looked up to her in a way I guess. Eventually, she came out as bisexual and began to use any pronouns, I don't think she put a label on her gender yet. But either way, she and I have always talked about putting on dresses and suits together. Since she is assigned female at birth (AFAB), she said she'd wear a dress if I ever wore a suit. And that has always been an ongoing thing.   

She moved in the summer and made a bunch of new friends at school who support her and she started painting her nails with Sharpie, typical ""rebellious teen"" stuff. Well her friend, we'll call them Rue, used actual nail polish to paint her nails. I was alright with that because I saw how happy it made my girlfriend. Why would I be upset when she is smiling from ear to ear. But today my girlfriend told me that Rue was going to bring her a suit to change into at her homecoming dance. I don't know why that was the breaking point but I was filled with so much anger and jealousy, I could've started to cry right there. I wanted to be the first one to paint her nails, but that's not a big deal. That's fine. But I always thought me being in a dress for the first time and her being in a suit for the first time was something we would share. She noticed I seemed a bit off but I didn't want to say anything and upset her so we just stopped talking and focused on school for the rest of the day.

I got home from school and took a nap. When I woke up, I saw that she had texted me. Something completely unrelated happened with work and got me frustrated and upset again so the jealousy came back. She noticed and asked me to open up. Me, not wanting to hide anything from her, did and she got really upset. We didn't fight or anything but I could tell she felt really bad. She asked me if I wanted her to say never mind about the suit and I told her it was alright because she seemed so excited about it. It feels selfish to make her say no to it. AITA?

edit: we talked it over and i apologized to her. i told her that if she wanted to wear a suit and paint her nails that was her choice and i would stand by her. i’m trying to not let my jealousy and emotions get the best of me""",1,Male,genderbent

"""My husband is 23, I'm 25, we were married last November. He did not go to college after high school. He just really did not enjoy school and didn't want to, at that time, take on the 4 year degree. He got the itch though, to at least get an associate's degree, he felt like it would give him a sense of fulfillment. 

The problem, more and more frequently, was that I was doing the work for him. He'd have a paper due, for example, and rather than take it on himself, he'd beg me, guilt trip me really, do a whole cutesy puppy dog pout, sad eyes, "" Baby, c'mon please, I love you"" thing, top it off with hugs and kisses, until I cracked. I'd type up a paper and he'd go in, keep most of it, but would change it a bit so it sounded like him. I felt guilty from the start because A) it's dishonest and B) if I'm doing the work, than he's not learning anything and it's just me going to college again.

The guilt became too much, I told him I was done, and that his work was going to have to be his. He feels that I'm abandoning him and not fulfilling the role of being a helpful partner. He wants to find a happier medium wherein, I'm still doing a chunk of the work, but, not so much that guilt comes in, which, I don't think can be done. He says if and when his grades tank, I'll be the one to blame.

"To start, my wife and I keep our pre-marital money in separate pots and all incoming money in a joint pot. All our income and expenses go in and come out of the joint pot and it's something we both wanted and I feel like I should also say that her pre-marital pot was bigger than mine when we got married.

Last year, my former company IPO'd and so my premarital pot is pretty big now. There's this place my parents usually rent out a cottage for a week or so during the summer but last year, it was all booked up. So this year, it's all booked up again and my parents were talking about how there's one cottage currently being listed but it'd be quite the stretch for them. So I decided that I pay for half the cottage (~100k for my half). Also, the only reason I took that job is because of encouragement from my parents, it paid less than my other offers but I thought what they were doing was interesting. So we got the cottage and they over the moon! They've been there every other week this summer. 

So my parents like to exaggerate, they've been telling their friends I bought the cottage for them even though I only paid for half and word got to my in-laws. They've been wanting to move closer to us for a while, so they want us to help them purchase a house near us. They'll sell their current home and use some savings so the extra that we'd have to cover would also be about 100k. However, this amount would drain most of my wife's pot and I don't want to take that much from our joint pot. My wife isn't pressuring me at all, I agreed at one point, but she vetoed it because I didn't sound fully okay with it. My inlaws think I'm TA because I'm treating them differently from my parents and they think all assets should be joint in a marriage.

Though we agreed everything earn after marriage is joint, she earns about 50% more than me. I'm also getting messages from others from her side of the family telling me I'm being selfish, that I'm freely spending her money (in our joint pot) but preventing her from using it on her parents. So maybe I should be okay with her taking that much out from our joint pot since she earned more of it? So am I the asshole for not wanting so spend the money on my inlaws even though I did the for my parents?

Edit: For those calling my parents liars, apparently they just said I helped them with the purchase and seems like by the time it reached my in-laws threw threw the broken telephone, the thought they bought the whole thing. But even if they did, it’d still be with her money, not mine.",0,Male,genderbent
"""My fiancé (24M, together 4 years, engaged for 2) and I (24F) both make enough to support ourselves independently, but live together in a house we rent. He makes slightly less than me (still over $75K post tax), but it’s equal enough that splitting bills 50/50 is fair, we have a joint savings account for our wedding and future expenses that we contribute equally to, and our own separate bank accounts for everything else. We call it our 'fun money,' since we have no kids and don’t plan to have any for a few years.

I don’t criticize his purchases, even if I think some are ill-advised. He saved up and bought himself a Peloton two months ago; I told him how cool I thought it was and how I knew he was going to have a ton of fun on it. It’s become a clothing rack in our living room. He has a lot of tools and gadgets that are really nice. But, he’s a tad bit reckless and has damaged or broken things worth thousands of dollars. I strictly never say anything super critical about it because it’s his money.

But, for years he’s told me how boring he thinks my shoe collection is, but never expressed real hatred for it. Four years ago, it was worth $5-10,000 and was stuff I’d accumulated since I was a kid. I continued buying, and spent a lot of my 'fun money' on my favorite designer shoes. I would often refrain from buying expensive luxuries so I could save up for my Holy Grail: a pair of Louboutin heels. I purchased them in January 2019, and since then the market for luxury shoes has soared.

My collection is now worth somewhere near $750,000, and I haven’t had any urge to stop adding to it. My fiancé thinks it’s time to just keep what I have and stop adding to it, because I 'keep spending [my] 'fun money' on shoes.' He brought this up when we were just chatting about our days in the living room. I told him I spent $6,000 on an extremely rare pair of Louboutin heels, and he seemed taken aback. When I brought up how he doesn't criticize my 'fun money' spending, he asked what there was to criticize. So, I told him basically what I stated above.

I didn’t even think it was turning into anything major until he stormed off after I stopped my sentence. I followed him into the kitchen and asked if something I said was offensive, and he told me that I was being financially irresponsible for 'investing in such a stupid concept' and 'misunderstanding the meaning of having 'fun money.'' He personally believes I should sell the whole collection and set us up for a stable retirement with a more traditional investment portfolio, but also said he’d never pressure me to do that. The discussion ended with him deciding to sleep in the guest room tonight.

I only think I might be an asshole because having such a money-heavy hobby can seem extremely risky, but I also believe that since it’s my 'fun money,' I should be able to do whatever I want with it as long as I’m still contributing financially to our relationship and our future. AITA?

Edit: Just adding that everything is insured, properly documented, and organized. I plan on talking to my fiancé after work specifically about my shoe hobby and what he thinks about it. If he’s serious about wanting me to have a giant sell-off to fund our 20s, I have to seriously consider if he’s the type of person I can trust with serious amounts of money, whether that’s in savings or in something physical like shoes. I’m genuinely not looking forward to it because I have a bad feeling he’s looking for the huge lump sum of funds right now.""",0,Female,genderbent
"My girlfriend (25F) has been learning English for a while. I (25M) have lived and studied in an English speaking country for a good number of years so I’m fully fluent. Lately, she’s been taking her learning more seriously and will switch to English in the middle of our conversations to practice. The expectation is that I play a teacher role, replying in English and pointing out any mistakes.

I don’t mind scheduling time to practice with her occasionally, but I hate teaching and switching to English considerably lowers the quality of our interactions. I always prefer to speak to her in our mother tongue and have asked her not to start randomly speaking to me in English.

She’s very hurt because she thinks I’m not supporting her in something that’s very important to her and very low effort for me (her words). My unwillingness also makes her feel “like an idiot” since she thinks I’m indirectly saying that she's slow and bad at the language.

I told her there are plenty of people who are looking for a language exchange online she could leverage and she doesn’t have to practice with me because I don’t like being a teacher.

My f33 husband m27 lost his beloved dog carrot 2 months ago. It was devastating for him because she used to be his emotional support animal. She was his close friend and a source of comfort. My husband suffers from multiple mental health problems. He'd experience desppression and panic episodes several times regularly. He takes medication but it isn't doing much. He told me he wanted a new dog and wanted my help and I agreed to help him but while I was looking he already got a german shepard and named her ""Timmy"" or ""Tim"" which is my original name. I was puzzled when he said ""meet Tim, Timmy, Isn't she adorable?"". I was taken aback I asked if that was her original name when he got her but he said no but he decided to give her this name. I was upset but kept my mouth shut but he started introducing her to friends and family and say Tim and Timmy. People several times got confused asking ""oh you talking about Timmy the dog or Timmy your wife?"". I felt awful as my name being mixed up with the dog's name constantly. My friends and inlaws took this opportunity to laugh at me and make the topic of their funny conversations. It extended to the social media as well.

My husband yesterday posted that today was Timmy's birthday. I started getting confused calls from work and even people who didn't know me that well that it was my birthday. I found out about the post and blew up telling my husband that naming his dog after me was disrespectful and just wrong. He argued that he really likes the name and that it ""fits her"" but I said that this was ridiculous and he needed to change the name asap and save me from further humiliation. He refused and I insisted he then began crying saying I clearly don't care about how Timmy's helping him feel better after Carrot's death and that I was too selfish focusing on a name rather than his happiness. He kept avoiding me while constantly shouting out ""Tim"" and ""Timmy"" then say he meant to call the dog.

"Okay so a little backstory. Before I met and moved in with my fiancée, I had a Bernese mountain dog mix named Harley. He’s now about three years old. We also have two cats, the three of them all get along great.

The other day while we were driving home, we saw a dog abandoned on the side of the road. We saved him, thinking we were going to take him to the shelter the next day when it opened. But my fiancée now has her heart set on keeping this dog.

He’s some type of Rottweiler I think, he has an injured ear, is underweight, and very obviously has been abused.

That being said, Harley and this dog do not get along at all. We tried introducing them slowly, walking them together, feeding them separately, etc. They are fighting all the time, to the point where I am now even scared of this dog (and I’m a diehard dog person so this is saying something). The cats have pretty much stayed away and not come inside for anything but their dinner. (We live in a rural area where outside indoor cats are the norm, we need them to keep mice away but I also love them?)

I’ve tried sharing my feelings, but she is convinced I’m just being anxious and that facing my anxieties is the “only way to grow” but it feels like more than to me.

I’d be willing to compromise and get another dog as long as it isn’t this dog! We can take my dog to the shelter to see who she gets on with or try to find a puppy.

"To be fair, I’ve always been a little picky about the phone. Ever since I’ve met my now husband he’s been addicted to his phone. Either constantly on social media or texting his family/friends, or just general use. It bothers me because it doesn’t matter what we’re doing, he’s never really in the moment.
We’ve recently had a baby and coupled with the pandemic my family is on overdrive with face time, we’re talking any time of the day they feel like calling they will. What makes it worse is that he will pickup no-matter-what when they call, and only them. Texts and calls from friends and other family he will ignore but his immediate family is an automatic answer no matter what is going on at the moment.
Recently there have been two instances where his family has called while we’re in the middle of a conversation, and both times I was in the middle of a thought or sentence, and he has picked up the phone. This has made me feel pretty shitty as I feel like I can’t hold his attention or that he prioritizes them over me.
I explained to him that I’d like him to be in the moment with me more. That their calls have never been pressing and I would just want him to at least wait to call or text them back after our conversation. This of course struck a cord with him and now he claims he I’ve given him anxiety about the phone ringing in my presence, even if we aren’t conversing. I’ve tried to explain and clarify over and over again that I just want him to at least finish our conversation and not allow them to be disruptive, but I can’t help but feel like an asshole because in his eyes I’m being controlling and triggered his anxiety.

"New Story:

I only specifically asked if she’d pick up the groceries from now on though. 

After talking to her about it. She agreed to start. I thought it was great. And was kind of shocked. She was suddenly doing all the cleaning and cooking by the time I got home. She was going to the grocery store and doing the laundry. 

But then I recently discovered that she’s just been having my 17 yo daughter do it. I guess I should’ve known since she went from having never used a stove, to suddenly cooking these beautiful dinners. 

I only found out cause my wife told me she had got everything from the grocery store. But my daughter told me they were out of Coke’s when *she* went. I asked her about it and she said that her mother had told her that I asked her to pick up some of the chores. And so she had her do it. 

She said that I was being unreasonable for being upset and that that’s just how she is. But I don’t think I am. I’ve been falling over myself thanking her for the things I’ve done for 20 years. And I feel like an idiot.

"When my (23) ex partner got with me, they already had a 3 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Honestly, raising their daughter as a young, single father is the hardest thing they've ever had to do, but they've been able to come out of the experience as a better person. After they moved in with me, they also had their second daughter, who is now 2. They also have a 17 year old cat, who they found on the street, and who they were able to nurse back to full health.

Despite their hard work, which involved caring for their children and their cat, I never seemed to have time for them, since I worked as a doctor in a hospital. I understand that my job is somewhat stressful, but as their partner and the father to one of their children, I seemed to prioritize relaxation over investing in spending time with them. They'd be lucky if they had a few hours with me in a week. In short, this was never going to work.

During our breakup, it was agreed by the courts that they would get to live in the house with our daughters and their cat until our youngest daughter moved out. I didn't take this news kindly to say the very least. From what they know, I'm currently having to share an apartment in the city to keep a roof over my head, even though I make £70,000 a year, so I could easily afford a nice place in London.

Which brings us to our current situation. I informed them that I couldn't look after our children for the weekend, due to ""work commitments."" They told me that our children want to see me, so I should make time for them. I snapped at them, and basically went off about how they'd stolen my dream home from me and effectively upended my life, despite the fact that I got the house from my parents after they retired to Portugal, so they're failing to understand my point. They'd be lying if they said this didn't anger them, so they made a Facebook post calling me out for undermining their work as a father and the fact that I couldn't make time for our children.

Their parents see no problem in their post, but their brother tried telling them that they need to take the post down, since it ""isn't making them look as good as they think it does."" They got into an argument, and they haven't spoken since. Despite my actions, they're thinking that they may have gone too far by posting their feelings on Facebook, despite them being warranted.

Whereas I could be celebrating a once in a lifetime event for one of my best friends and would hate not showing up for her. But then now I feel I am not supporting my bf. AITA?

Edit: it may sound Im apprehensive about him throwing another party simply because I don’t want to throw a party.

"New Story:

""Edit: I will not be getting a dog anytime soon. Our apartment was approved for dogs of a certain size, so nobody has to get concerned. It’s more just to see if I’m really in the wrong here. 

A week before I (23m) met my girlfriend (26f) I adopted a puppy who has since been a member of our family. We love dogs, I come from a background where love our dogs and have owned many, and she appears to have the same mindset without even ever owning any. 
Dog training and dog care has been a passion of mine ever since I met her. My plan is to own a ton of dogs someday, just like my parents do. 
I live in a one-bedroom apartment that I pay for. My girlfriend lives with me, and I’ve only asked her to cover a bill or two and help with chores seeing as she doesn’t work a lot. 
We split taking care of our dog, one of us walks him in the morning, one of us at night. He’s very easy going and I think could really benefit from having another dog in the home. 
My girlfriend doesn’t want a dog until spring because she wants to be graduated from college before we get another dog. While that is fair, I work really hard for the things I have, animal work is a passion of mine, and considering I would have to pay for it anyway, I did the math and have enough that if the right dog came along I could easily and comfortably afford it. 
In preparation for wanting to add another dog to the home, I signed up to meet with an adoption agency, as it usually takes 6 months to get approved. However, we were able to get approved just yesterday. She was a part of the process. My girlfriend sat down with me and picked the dogs we were interested in potentially meeting. 
Well, as we just started to get messages tonight about meeting up with the fosters of the dogs we pick, she told me that “it’s not a good time right now and that we need to wait”. She also said “we agreed on spring,” so she wants to honor that.
I was pretty mad. I put in the work, I pay for everything, and she tells me that she doesn’t want it anymore. I feel like she strung me along, helping me pick out which dogs we wanted to see. 
She told me I was acting like a spoiled child who wasn’t getting his way. This was something I had my heart set on, something I worked hard for, but I feel like she’s toying with me. 
I could be the AH for not honoring her feelings about when she’s ready, but considering I would be the one paying for it and she went through the entire process with me, I feel like it’s unfair to me to just pull out. AITA?""",1,Male,genderbent
"""I (31f) bought a house when I was 24. My boyfriend (25m) and I started dating when I was 28, and he moved in last year. 

Every now and then, I refer to the house, or something large in it/about it (the roof, a door, usually in reference to things that need fixing or doing) as ""my"" out of habit.

He gets upset and chides me, saying it's ""our"".

The thing is, since he moved in he hasn't paid a cent of mortgage. Not even electrical, gas, or trash. He'll occasionally help with chores and housework but big things that need fixing, or emergencies that need paying for come from me. So I don't feel like it's much of an ""our"" at all.

"GF(f/19) and I (m/22) both come from immigrant families but our situations are very different. my parents (mid 40s) immigrated as teens, integrated very well, built a great life for themselves & our family is well off financially and socially. 

GF’s family is a bit different; they came to this country about 4 years ago and GF (younger daughter) has adapted the best.

they don’t have a lot of money so both daughters live with their parents to support them. parents don’t work but attend language courses daily. mother is sadly suffering with multiple health conditions.

her parents aren’t very independent: e.g. they can’t make their own appointments due to the language barrier etc. I started making appointments for them and found a translator so MIL could see an expert.

the problem is her dad.

he is the same age as my dad, but he seems to not be able to do anything on his own.

just a few weeks ago he waited for GF to come home and drive him to water his friend’s plants (friend was on vacation), instead of walking on his own for 10min.

I love him a lot and he loves me a lot, but it does get on my nerves.

I'm not used to it: if my dad wants to spend a weekend in another city, he’ll organize everything himself but FIL can’t even ride the bus to his doctor.

this is putting a strain on our relationship since it further clogs up GF’s busy schedule (fulltime job + daily sports practice).

even when we went on vacation (1 week, first vacation alone) he called daily and sent 20min voice messages every morning (nothing important happened, he also does this when she sleeps over) which really got on my nerves.

I sent my parents some updates and pictures and called my mom (only week we could get off was her birthday week). we were gone for ONE week!!!

she noticed that I was annoyed and we got into an argument, but it stopped before there was any  conclusion.

she said that family is a priority for her (implying that it isn’t for me???).

she spends a lot of her nights helping her dad with his homework instead of her own or sleeping. I feel like I’m the only one concerned for her health/future (e.g. FIL asked her to help him prep food at night when she was clearly sick and needed rest, I told her over text that it can wait and she should sleep, she said he can’t do it alone).

I’m afraid that he’ll turn into an overbearing FIL once we get married (we plan to get married after I graduate uni in 3-4 years). GF has promised that he’ll mind his own business but I’m not so sure about that.

I know how awful FIL’s can be (best example: my paternal grandfather) and I don’t want to suffer like my dad.

I personally plan to take care of my own parents, once they are too old to do so themselves but to my parents the most important thing is that I have a good future. I do a lot of household chores, since I’m currently still living with my parents but they’d never ask me to clean the whole house when they know I have an exam coming up (not the same but it’s about the principle).

"""My girlfriend (23F) and I (21M) have been together for a little over 2 years. She's genuinely an awesome person and we are really happy together.

One of the only things about her that bothers me is that she loves me the way I am right now, meaning she doesn't really want me to change anything about myself.
It's not that she forbids me anything, but she makes it clear that she's not happy with certain things. 

This happened once so far, but it was a pretty big deal to her. That time I went to get a haircut, which I normally don't really do but I wanted it for once. I didn't tell her about it because I didn't think it was a big deal, but turns out she finds shorter hair really unattractive and kind of didn't want me to touch her with the new haircut. Imo opinion she overreacted, but if I had told her beforehand she could have told me about this.
So I grew my hair out again. (Bye neat haircut)

Now I really want a piercing and a tattoo.
I already had 2 piercings on each ear and a large tattoo on my back when we got together, and she never had a problem with them.
About 6 months ago I told her I would want to get another tattoo at some point, and she said she didn't really understand why I would get another one. She didn't say she was opposed to it but I know she kinda is.

Fast forward to this week. I made an appointment to get the eyebrow piercing I've wanted for a long time and I'm getting it next week. I've also had a tattoo idea in my head to honour / remind me of my mom and I've decided I want to schedule an appointment with an artist.

I haven't told my girlfriend about the piercing appointment or my plans to get the tattoo because I'm scared she'll react the same way as with the haircut.
While I think it would be hypocritical for her to have a problem with it, since I already have a large back tattoo and ear piercings, I still think it could be an asshole move to just do it without telling her.

WIBTA for doing this?

Edit 1: So lots of people think I should talk to her about wanting the piercing and tattoo before getting them. If she doesn't accept / respect my decision or tries to change my mind I should explain that I still have bodily autonomy and she is allowed to dislike my decision, but I'm still doing it.

I'm planning on having this conversation this evening with her. I'll update asap. Thanks for all the replies!

Edit 2: Okay so I talked to her last night and she didn't take it great but not really bad either.
I told her that I was getting an eyebrow piercing and that I have an appointment on Monday to get it done with a good friend of mine.
I also asked her if she remembered me talking about getting a tattoo for my mom (about 6 months ago), and told her I had decided I wanted to get it, although no appointments have been made yet.

Her first reaction was - as I expected - ""but why would you do that?"" and ""it's not necessary"". I proceeded to explain to her that I really want them and it'll make me happy, to which she replied ""will it?"".
I also told her that she is allowed to not like these kinds of changes, but that I still want to be able to do them and I won't change as a person because I make a change in my appearance.

I think she got the message, saying ""I guess I'll have to live with them [the tattoo and piercing] but I won't love you less.""
She acted kinda sad during the conversation yesterday, but she was / is still affectionate and I'm positive once I have them she'll get over it.

"AITA Hi me(22 )and my gf (21)of four years recently went and saw her mother.

"A situation that I'm seriously debating mostly because I think it'd be funny, but also, useful.

I (29, M) am getting married to my fiance (30, F) in two weeks.

One of my pet peeves is when people other than the groom wear white to weddings. In the US - especially midwest (if you're not from here), this is a well-known NO NO, and it's seen as disrespectful.

We were at a family wedding a couple weekends ago, and I noticed two family members that are also attending our wedding wearing white (probably closer to cream) pantsuit and dress.

The issue is, they play dumb so they act like they haven't heard basic wedding etiquette.

My solution to this is to buy cheap bright green t-shirts and write in a sharpie ""I wore white to the wedding"", and so my wedding coordinator can hand them out to any guests breaking this ""rule"".

It's funny in theory, but idk if I can go through with it because it seems like I'm a bit of a groomzilla if someone actually has to wear it.

"""So my GF and I are in a long distance relationship because of school and her birthday is at the end of this month. She's turning 20 which is a big milestone and we got a really fancy dinner and hotel experience together for my 20th which I obviously wouldn't celebrate without her.

Thing is that when she got home from her last visit she informed me that she will be going home to her family for her birthday party 'cause she agreed to have a joint party with her 2 siblings and she said she didn't tell me in person because she didn't want me to get upset. Now this would be fine and all if it wasn't for the fact that I cannot stand her sister, much less the bf and friends she would be bringing and my GF is very aware of this meaning she knew it would be a celebration without me if she agreed to it.

She's now making me sound like the bad guy for not wanting to go (it's a 2+ hours travel one way even if I did, also expensive) even though she already knew that would be the case when she agreed to it. I feel like these big milestones is something you wouldn't dream of celebrating without your SO so I'm feeling very hurt by all of this, especially the lack of empathy from her side.

"My husband (32M) and I (34F) had a complicated start to our relationship. He was still in a relationship with his ex (32F) when we met and first became intimate but he *did not* cheat on her. As a result, when he became pregnant with Ava, she denied all knowledge and relationship to the child and insisted it was mine even with all evidence to the contrary (to put it bluntly: different races).

My husband and I have been together for nine years now. We have three children: a son from my previous relationship, Ava, and one little girl together. Ava is now eight years old and he knows that he is not her biological mom. We have tried to be as open with Ava as is appropriate for her age and for her curiosity about her mother, but he plainly isn't curious about her identity. My husband has never pursued his ex for child support or money or anything. When she got married a few years ago, she told us she did not want Ava to ever get in touch with her and told me that I adopted her on the condition that she never consider her or look for her as her mother.

For Ava's eighth birthday, my husband put up pictures of her party up on Facebook, and his ex's brother (Ava's uncle) got in contact with him to ask after Ava and gently hint that their father (Ava's grandfather) would love to meet and get to know her, given the chance. We spoke to Ava about it, and he was interested, so he and his grandfather have had a few lunches together and are starting to develop a relationship. However, the last time we went to Ava's grandfather's house, my husband's ex was waiting outside and started an argument about us breaking our agreement by having Ava in her childhood home and spending time with her family.

However, in my opinion, she has no role to play in any of this - Ava is getting to know her grandfather, and that has nothing to do with her, even though that is her father. AITA?",0,Female,genderbent

"AITA? so for background, my boyfriend is 25 weeks pregnant and he’s been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum so he is literally throwing up or sick almost all the time. it’s especially bad at night and last night was very rough. I, who is normally super supportive and wonderful, take about 30-45 minute poops in the morning.

so this morning he was feeling horrible and I was in our bathroom. he tried to wait but he ended up having to throw up. he ended up going to our roommate's bathroom to throw up. his bathroom isn’t in his room like ours is but at the end of our hallway next to our roommates room. when I came out of the bathroom I said something along the lines of “idk why you didn’t just tell me to wrap it up and probably woke up our roommate” and made him feel really guilty for throwing up in that bathroom. for reference, it was about 4am. he honestly did not have time for me to wrap it up because he had already almost threw up on the floor trying to get to a bathroom. he also does not particularly want to put his face next to a toilet I was just taking a poop on.

he honestly gets that it’s early and he didn’t want to wake me up but it was an emergency. he did get upset with me after this and said something like “yeah I gotta throw up so f me right” which he does believe was a little out of line. he is just miserable, pregnant, and sick. our roommate is also super chill and understanding. I’m sure if I was woken up and knew it was because he was sick, I wouldn’t be upset.

"Hi All. Long time Redditer, throwaway for this one. OK, been with my boyfriend for 5 years. Super great relationship, until now. Both over 45, ok, maybe one of us is 50ish+. He had a birthday comming up on Wednesday, let's say on week 2. Problem is, I knew that I had a 6 hour redeye flight, plus timezone change, to take on the Monday of week 2, all day meetings on Tuesday, and then a 6 hour redeye back, plus timezone change, on Wednesday morning, which would be his birthday. I knew I was going to be trashed from the travel travel schedule. So, I planned ahead, on week 1, the week before his birthday, we went out on friday, nice new football jersey present, painted the town, stayed at a hotel friday to saturday just to escape the race and everything that goes with that. Had a great time.

Got on the flight, came home wednesday, trashed as exptected, barely got my ass out of bed, and, yup, forgot to say happy birthday on his actually f\*cking birthday. Then, the next day, he brought it up, as a weapon, and I was wrecked. I could not believe that I actually missed it, especially after all the planning in advance. It was not good, and I was upset and appologetic. Since then, it's been like an ice storm around here. Keep in mind I was a frigg'n zombie on the important day.

I'm also a bit upset that he didn't protect the relationship from this. I obviously planned a great birthday in advance because I knew I was going to be trashed from the travel. All he had to do was playfully say, at the end of the day, ""is there anything you want to tell me before we go to sleep tonight?"" I would have triggered, and all would have been good. But, no, he let it ride, stewed on it, and then sprang it after the fact. OK, the reality is, I missed the day, have to own that, I get it. But, I'm not happy about this part. I also have'nt brought it up, does'nt feel right.

Still ice around here.

I'm at the point where I'm ready to let him do his thing. If he wants to warm up and come back, I'm open arms. If he wants to ice what was a great thing over this, the door is over there. Hav'nt said that yet, but that's the feeling. I just don't see how I can save this myself.

"""Some background:

My Wife (36) and I (M31 currently 5 months pregnant with baby #6) have had pets throughout our entire marriage so far. When we met she had a dog R who died of old age shortly after our oldest child turned 6 months. We have had our cat J since she found him at a stable she worked at the summer before we got married. Once we bought our first house and our 3rd baby was 6 months we bought two dogs Y and B. In 2020 she was working on site and found a small black kitten huddled under equipment trying to keep warm in the freezing Feb. temperatures. We brought her home, our then 3 (now 5) year old fell in love with her and E became my daughter's cat. They slept together at night, she helped feed her and generally took care of E. She is the sweetest cat ever.

Now to the problem;

I told my wife that as the pets pass away and leave our home, I didn't want any more pets. J, who is now old, sick and generally failing in health. We started a discussion this summer about getting J put down due to his health issues and quality of life. His meds are extensive and expensive, he can't make it to any of the litter boxes (we have over 5 in the house) and i can't keep cleaning up his messes. His quality of life is so minimal. We have set an appointment to have him released from this life. We are letting him go this weekend.

Unfortunately E got out three weeks ago, and hasn't come home. I have put up flyers all over the neighborhood, posted on several facebook groups locally and hit all the nearby humane societies every time I see a cat that looks like E. I have even checked their DOA reports from animal control in hope of some closure. All to no avail. E has either been taken by a wild animal or someone picked him up and isn't giving him back. She was never meant to be outside ever so we never microchipped her (which i now regret) with all this online and in person visiting of the humane society, i have come across several cats who look just like E, but are not her. Our shelters are overwhelmed here.

My daughter dearly misses her cat, she asks form almost every night, and now with putting J down I suddenly find myself Catless, which I didn't expect to happen so suddenly or like this. I know what I said about not getting any more pets, but I have found myself suddenly depressed over all this. I want to take my daughter to the humane society and let her pick a new kitten. I acknowledge that this is a knee-jerk reaction to our situation and that my pregnancy hormones are probably playing a huge role.

WIBTA if I took my daughter to get another kitten? My wife hasn't flat out said no to it, but we can't agree on the type of cat to get, which is why I would let our daughter choose.

(I am aware of the Pet tax, unfortunately I cannot share photos for privacy reasons with all the posts i have made looking for E I am worried someone will fully figure out who I am. I am looking to remain anonymous for many reasons.)""",0,Male,genderbent
"""I (22m) lost over 100 pounds in the past 3 years. Because of this I have a lot of loose skin. I went to the doctor and he said I can have surgery to remove the skin on my stomach.

My wife (22f) doesn't want me to get it until 1 year later as she will be with me. We are not together now because of immigration delays.

It pissed me off because I don't talk to anyone about my medical problems, and rather than coming up with a compromise, this is all I get.

Our roof went out, I lost my job for three months but I got it back. We have been dipping into our savings to make ends meet. We are finally getting a bit of breathing room now. 

SIL has a big dog that needs surgery for cancer I think. SIL doesn't have all of the $, so she asked my wife for 5k. Wife mentioned casually during dinner that she was going to lend her sister that money. I kind of flipped because that’s half of our entire savings. What happens if we have a big unexpected cost? 

I told my wife that she can use money from her individual savings if she wants to pay her sister but not our household savings. She told me that she has less than $100 in her personal savings but that she supported me for three months and so technically a big chunk of the savings really were hers.

However, since we started living together over a year ago, she has just played her computer game all day long and chooses to prioritize it over myself and our dog. I have tried to talked to her about it numerous times and she always says she’s not addicted to it and I’m just making it up, etc. she refuses to believe it is not normal for her to play all day, everyday. 

When it comes to doing things around the house, she hardly helps unless I ask. And I am the one to make sure all the bills are paid on time, but she does pay for half of the bills. She grew up in a wealthy home so she never had to do these tasks. But her dad made sure she knew how to do them for when she got older. She also refuses to watch our dog alone. She says she doesn’t feel comfortable alone with him which really annoys me sometimes because I have a great work from home but can’t even watch him or watch him without complaining when I have important meetings because she claims she has to focus on her game. 

Tonight, we got in a fight after she said she can’t hangout with me because she has to play her game and she’s not going to go without playing her game for a day. I told her she was addicted to her game and it’s more important to her than our relationship and if she wants to go back to living at her parents house with no friends (other than her online friends) and no future then be my guest.  She then called me an AH and hasn’t spoken to me since. 

I kinda feel bad about what I said but I am getting fed up with her behavior. Am I the AH? 

I would be fine with her playing her game if she didn’t prioritize it over our relationship. That’s what upsets me the most. One night, I asked her if she had to choose between me or the game what would it be? She said she would never quit the game, hinting that she would rather break up.

Edit: She was a professional gamer for 3 years, when we met so I knew she liked to game but I never thought it would get to this point. Also, she plays Runescape. I have talked/vented to her dad about it because he completely agrees and has tired to talk about it and she doesn’t listen to him either. She believes we’re all against her. She has made comments about me acting like her dad before. Where I’ve told her, I in no way want to act like her dad but when she can’t do simple things like take the trash out, put the right things in the recycle bin, or do things in a timely manner then she forces me to ask her to do this things. If she would help vacuum or empty the dishwasher, etc. without asking numerous times then I wouldn’t have to act like her dad. I just want to be her boyfriend, not her maid, dad, etc.""",0,Male,genderbent
"""I've been sick for over a week. She hasn't done anything to help me while I'm sick. (Food, etc)

I told her I'm extremely disappointed. Ive mentioned it 3x since I've gotten sick. Tonight it blew up. She said I'm not sick enough to have to be taken care of. She said I have a horrible cold, not cancer.

I have been sleeping on the couch (I'm much taller and bigger. The couch isn't uncomfortable to me). I've been sleeping there so she didn't get sick.

My feelings are if I'm not sick enough for you to help out at all, I'm not sick enough for you to worry about getting sick from me sleeping in our bed.

I'm now lying in my bed.

But of course, I am sick enough to not sleep next to me. So she's on the couch.

AITA to know she's going to wake up sore as anything, even though I'm really upset with her.""",0,Male,genderbent

""On mobile.

My partner (21F) and I (21M) have an agreement about our rent/utilities. She makes a good bit more than me so she agreed to pay full rent while I agreed to pay all utilities. 

It’s our second month in our new place, and we’ve had the bill for our power for a while now saying it’s due today. My partner has been putting it off because she keeps running out of money. She doesn’t make much, and most of her paychecks go straight back into her work. She’s been paying for a new bike as a mode of transport for a few weeks now, and today put the last payment down so we could take it home. She had enough money leftover to pay the power bill and said she would when she got home. 

When we got home, I asked her to pay the bill and she said she couldn’t because she had to spend over half of her remaining money on a work thing and would be able to pay the bill in a few days instead. That really upset me because she’s been putting it off for so long and said she would pay it today. I’m worried about our power getting shut off since it’s a violation of our lease agreement, and I told my partner it really upset me that she wasn’t trying to pay it on time. She keeps shrugging it off and saying everything is gonna be fine but I’m really upset about it. 

She got upset with me for not brushing it off as no big deal when I really think it’s a big deal to pay bills on time. She left for work a little early because I upset her and now I feel bad. AITA?""",0,Male,genderbent
"""I (27M) am currently engaged to H (27F), my partner of >5 years. H is South Asian and I am Latina.

In the time that I've been with H, my parents (60F, 59M) have shown themselves to be very cruel to me. Every break, holiday, or weekend visit to my parents' home always ends in a big fight with my mother constantly threatening to kick me out.

When we first got engaged in late 2019, we planned on not asking for financial support for our wedding ceremony and reception. Together, we could afford a nice, little wedding with the people we truly cared about and all the bells and whistles we wanted. Unfortunately, my parents pressured us to invite so many more people than we were financially able to afford. In the 18 COVID month pause, my parents insisted that if we were to ask them for money for the wedding, they would call the shots. They wanted us to do a traditional South Asian wedding. H's Catholic traditions would be restricted to having a short prayer during the signing of paperwork.

A couple of months ago, all these plans fell apart when we found out that my parents were pressuring us to do emotional labor (being the go-between during the many family fights, driving people around when they visited our city, accepting comments about my recent pandemic weight gain, etc) and they had not put down any deposits for our wedding.

When I confronted my parents, they said horrible things about me, H, and her parents (56F, 54M). They said we were only looking to swindle them from their money. My parents reasoned that they would not put down deposits until they met her parents. There were a few issues with that. 1) We were never told that deposits were contingent on this. 2) Our parents live over 200 miles apart. 3) in her culture, there is a specific wedding custom where the groom's family is invited over to the bride's family home to ask for the bride's hand. My parents were informed about all of this and they decided they did not care.

So we decided we did not care cancelled the wedding.

Here is where I think I might be the asshole: my partner and my parents have not had much of a relationship since then. My parents text her daily that she is breaking their heart by not calling or texting back. Today is my dad's birthday and we were supposed to go visit him for the weekend as a surprise. When my father found out about the surprise, he texted me and forbid her from visiting for his birthday. He stated that she was disrespectful and was not a part of the family because she had not called when the family dog passed away recently.

My parents have now involved my sister (22F). My sister is texting us that she will stop having a relationship with us unless we fix this with my parents. My parents are blowing up our phones that they have been crying every day because of me and her. I also keep getting texts that I'm tearing their family apart.

So AITA for tearing my partner's family apart?

UPDATE: I've seen your messages and comments about my obvious need to accept blame. I will bring this up during my regular therapy sessions this week. H and I have talked about this post and H is completely ready to go back to the NC state she was in before wedding planning became a fiasco. She states that she moved 1,000 miles from her parents because of their narcissism. We will be having a talk with my sister this weekend.""",0,Male,genderbent
"""This is an old situation I’ve long wondered about.  
My now-wife (F) and I met in college. Her high school friend group included a guy, B, who had a crush on her but never got his chance with her.  
Every time F went home over college break, B would shoot his shot, even though he knew she was with me. F told me and politely shut him down and they drifted apart a little. They did still talk online some.  
A couple years after graduation, F and I got our first apartment together. One weekend I was traveling to visit family. B happened to be road tripping cross-country that weekend and asked F if he could stay at our place along the way.  
I had met B once at this point when we were in her hometown visiting family. He literally pushed me out of the way to fling himself in her arms.  
F asked me and I said no, I wasn’t comfortable with him staying in our apartment given that I was pretty sure he still had a thing for her and I wouldn’t be there.  
I’ve definitely had jealousy issues in the past, which are on me- F is amazing and attractive but has never given me any reason not to trust her. So AITA for not letting him stay at our place because I didn’t trust him?""",0,Male,genderbent
"""Backstory: my girlfriend (25F) and I (25M) have been dating for almost 6 years. We met and started dating in college and overall we have a really good relationship. There is one reoccurring issue that arises and I want to see how other people view this issue. She’s always on my case saying I should go to the gym (she goes around 5-6x a week and really loves it). Me on the other hand? I fucking hate the gym and honestly even the thought of going there and working out kinda just pisses me off? I really can’t explain why but I just have never really gone to the gym and I’ve never liked it. (I’m still active and played sports it’s just like the gym and fitness related things). Here’s the thing though, the reason she wants me to go to the gym is so I can grow a bigger ass. Literally that’s what she says at this point, she makes backhanded comments about it sometimes that make me feel like shit about it and insecure but she justifies it by saying ‘it’s something that I have the ability to change’ But her comments have made me not want to go even more now because it’s just aggravating to me and I wouldn’t be doing it for myself I’d be doing it to please her. She says she wants me to be healthy too and stuff but I think it’s pretty clear her main concern is me growing a bigger ass. I’m 5’9 1/2 and I weigh around 118, I have a hyperactive thyroid so I have always been really skinny and by no means did I have more of an ass when we started dating than I do now? My body has stayed pretty much the same, and My stomach is toned so it’s not like I look unhealthy. Which is another thing that makes it hard for me to gain motivation because I am so skinny that if you saw me you would probably think I work out a lot based on my body frame, so it makes me feel like what’s the point of I already look the way I want without having to do anything? I admit that’s super lazy of me and I know that even though I am thin it’s still healthy to go to the gym so I don’t really need comments pushing that cause I get it but that’s not the issue here. Also to add, not trying to sound conceded at all, but for context I and others would consider myself to be very attractive and my girlfriend and I frequently get called ‘the hot couple’ and ‘goals’. So she’s got no other issues with my appearance and that’s annoying to me too, that me having a big ass is something she cares so much about when i have plenty of other good appearance features. Anyway, AITA for not going to the gym and not trying to make my ass bigger for my girlfriend or is she the asshole for pushing me to change my body and openly saying how flat it is in a shameful way because she wants it to look better?""",0,Male,genderbent
"""So some context
My BF has a job and he needs to move to LA in the next 2 weeks. He's been putting off moving while I find a job. I have been furiously applying everywhere and to everything and just getting destroyed by No’s. I have exhausted all my connections and friends.
I actually gave myself an ulcer earlier in the summer from the stress

I keep looking and getting close but so far nothing. My current job is with a family friend and tied to a location 


My BF and I attended a wedding over the weekend. During the rehearsal he was on his phone working. He commented how he hated his job and how he needs to find something better. Another groomsman who he barely knows said hey I could pass your resume along at my company 



So i only got a little info from him that night and I was like yea that’s great go for it.


So last night he said he has a phone interview. I am like that’s so great.
Do you think you could ask him for me to maybe help me get a role or pass me along?

He goes umm well what do you want?

I was like well anything in this category. He was like well look on the site. I did before I texted him. I was like okay I didn’t know that. I assumed the other groomsman knew of a role.

Then we get into a mini fight over it and it ends with

He didn’t ask you he asked me.

Then we go around in circles for a bit and I was like well don’t you think if he knew I was looking and needed to move cause you are pressuring me to move he would have made the same offer. Like I wasn’t in the wedding. So when I spoke to this man it was just what ever the group was talking about.


Some further context when my BF started his most recent role I said hey your company has a role I'd be good for do you think you could help me. We hashed it out and he said he doesn't want to work at the same company which makes sense 

But this is different cause it's a field he's never worked in. He’s very big in working in a field he loves. So this newer role would only be until he finds a role in his desired industry 

Whereas I am just trying to get a job to be out in LA with him.

The only reason I relented on moving to LA without a job was cause he was gonna sign a lease without me. But this Job he is trying to leave is also the reason he is moving out there. Now he is saying I can just come out when I'm ready

I think if anything we are both the asshole.
Maybe I shouldn’t have asked but also I prefaced it with I would apply to a different role and different dept or region since its remote

But also I just feel helpless and stressed in this job search and need to explore all avenues to be in LA with him""",1,Female,genderbent

Situation-

My gf works night shift (11pm-7am, remote) and I work day shift (I have to drive to work). I understand she has to talk to people for her job and just to vent with her friends/coworkers. My issue is that aside from her daily meetings with her shift team, she talks a lot with her friends. She would talk with them for over 2 hours before her meeting just to vent and discuss anything important for work, but mostly to vent. She talks loud and it feels like none of them ever wants to end the call. And then after the calls, my gf would go about with the meeting, which by then is past 2am. It really disrupts with my sleep schedule, especially I have to get up by 6:30 for work.

When I complain about it, she thinks I'm unreasonable and even says I'm jealous cause her friends happen to be males. Is not like I want to complain, I just wish she can see from my side. When I sleep, she's working and some noises, aside from her calls, are unpreventable, which wakes me up. When she's done with work in the morning, I have to go to work. She has the house to herself and can sleep in.

"TLDR: I'm the litter box cleaner because of a deal I made to get my second cat. Didn't realize I would be leaving for almost a year and my wife will have to do it. I'm thinking of getting my wife one of those robotic litter boxes for Christmas. I don't want it to be a getting your husband a vacuum for Christmas type deal. WIBTA?

When I married my wife she had 1 cat, basically her soul cat. She said that when he passes we won't get another cat because no one could live up to him. She knew I was in vet med and that statement probably wouldn't hold true for long. When I was deployed last year we had a cat come in that owners wanted to euthanize due to an injured tail and a guarded prognosis. Well, my wife fell in love with him and asked me if we could bring him home. I agreed only if she would take over litter box duty. She absolutely hated doing it for 1 cat and she knew she would hate it with another. (Also, we split household duties evenly before anyone says she wanted out of a chore) I had no problem with this at all. Our second cat was signed over to her and she brought him home a week later.

I come back home, love our new derp cat, and the added benefit of not doing litter boxes anymore. Fast forward a few months and I find out my wife will be deploying for 10ish months next year. This means I will be taking care of all the household tasks, including litter boxes, while she's gone.

I spoke with some friends that had robotic litter boxes and they speak nothing but good things about them. I'm worried that if I get her a $500 gift that is really just for the cats then I would be the AH. Is this basically like getting your husband a vacuum cleaner for Christmas? I typically do homemade gifts or experiences for her. Would this be a shitty (ha) gift to give her right before I leave? Is it better to just consider it a household purchase and not a gift?",1,Male,genderbent

I asked about it and was told that this symbol is used in their home country as a sign of good luck and prosperity. I suggested taking it down as for me, it is a sign of hate.

"For context: I (22m) asked my gf (25f) if she would take some time to write out a generalized 5 year plan for her future.

The reasoning being, we’ve been together for almost a full year, met each other’s families, live together and now she has started to lovingly joke about marriage and our future like it’s set in stone and going to happen. And while I’m super happy in this relationship and look forward to that, she is older and wants to settle down and I’m not there yet. In short, I want to make sure we see ourselves going down the same path before we become any more committed to each other or waste any more time together if it won’t work out long term.

I very casually suggested this on an evening when we both had a decent amount of time off and she pretty much threw a fit. She said it was depressing to her, very firmly said “no”, and that she prefers to live day by day. Which is true, but we’ve already come to a disagreement about the future in which something was a dealbreaker between us and we dropped the conversation and didn’t touch it again. I can never get her to talk about the future or her feelings or to plan anything. 

From what I’ve read online, that’s seen as a sign that she doesn’t see a future with us together, but I know that isn’t true because she’s already told her parents she wants to marry me and that she’s already decided on it. I just don’t want to make that commitment when we disagree on certain morals and values and it becomes an issue in the future. 

She gets super offended or defensive whenever I try to talk about boundaries or finances or the future and says it causes her stress and that’s not how she is. Am I the asshole for trying to make her have these conversations?",0,Male,genderbent

I ended up calling his friend because I felt bad for her and kind of wanted to help the problem so we could get our relationship back on track. He said he was sorry for being snappy and that he does care about me.

We came back from holiday and everything seemed fine but then he had to go and stay with his friend having the breakdown, which I accepted. The same day as this happened his brother relapsed and started drinking again. This really upset him and the two events combined meant that he had a really bad night.

The next day I went back to work after my holiday and received an email that I got a second interview for my dream job that I had to work really hard for the first interview. I was extremely excited. I met a friend for a drink after work and had a few. I came to my boyfriend's flat excited however he said not to celebrate as I had not got the job yet and that he had a really bad night and day. He ended up coming for a drink with me and my friend too.

I had about 4 1/2 beers total when he said something that upset me as it was condescending (I can’t remember exactly what it was) to which I replied - “yeah but don’t I earn more money then you?”. I instantly apologized after which he told me to get out of his sight and get my things from his flat. This spiraled into a big argument where I would keep apologizing and he would say things like “why are you upset?, your a big woman, you earn a lot of money”, which I would say “I’m sorry I didn’t mean it in response.

He kept saying I make everything about me, which I will admit is subconsciously something I do sometimes, not all the time.

I learned that yesterday and living in another country makes it harder as i cant be there for my family as much as id like. Last night, after hearing about the news, I was feeling shit and went out to distract myself, ended up drinking more than i should (not proud of it but thats how it is).

My bf wanted to meet in town today and I said i wasnt feeling good, mentally or physically, and i dont want to go out or even have him over. I literally just want to be alone and listen to music, as thats how i deal with things.

He took it personally and even though he didnt express his feelings, i can tell that he isnt happy about it. Basically just answered ""ok"" and isnt responding anymore.

My question is, is my need to be alone justified, or should i have made an effort to be with him?

She has already told most of her family except for her dad’s side with the exception of her cousin who she is really close with. I have told my parents and most of my siblings but plan on telling the rest by getting them tshirts saying aunt/uncle on it. We plan on making an announcement to the rest of our families/friends by the end of the month but aren’t sure if we want to tell her dad’s side (dad, grandma, grandpa, and aunt) yet as they don’t like me because they blame me for my gf wanting independence. Some of the things I’ve been blamed for is her moving out, her not having money to come see them every weekend when they live over an hour and a half away, and they think she has so much control over what I do. When we visit them I do my best to always be respectful and I never do/say anything rude or disrespectful as I want them to like me but no matter how nice I am they always find something rude to say. It’s usually a little side comment about me or they just don’t acknowledge me at all. Her dad doesn’t ever refer to me by my name, and if he can he tries to not even look at or talk to me. Her mom says that we should wait until after Christmas to tell them but I would be over halfway pregnant by then and they wouldn’t be able to come to/know about the gender reveal we have planned in November, and I think it would cause more drama overall because they will be the last ones to know.

I can only imagine how they will react once they know I’m pregnant, and it’s already a stressful time for me because this pregnancy has been very hard on me so far. When we do tell them, I don’t know whether telling them in person would be best or over the phone so that if things get out of hand we can hang up and tell them to call us when they have settled down.

Mistakes would include things like what I’ll describe below or things like forgetting things she put on the grocery list sometimes (not emergent stuff just snacks etc) I’ll admit I do make some mistakes sometimes because I’m not paying attention, but I’m not dirty, I try to keep on top of my chores and I also work. For years I’ve really felt like her standards are higher than average and I sit around average, this obviously causes stress because she gets very upset with me and it tends to end in tears. In my free time I like to do a variety of crafts and recently I started painting a little. I guess the other day when I was cleaning up for the end of day I must have wiped up a some paint with a Kleenex and then put it in my pocket. The only reason I can think of for doing this is that the baby started fussing and I went over to her quickly, I mean I guess I could have just done it because I had a stupid moment (I’m pretty tired). In any case the Kleenex with the wet paint ended up in the laundry and it put some small splotch like stains on a few pairs of underwear and some pyjamas. I know my wife thinks IATA for it, because I do forget things in my pockets and make other mistakes due to not paying attention. She feels I ruin our things “a lot” which honestly I don’t think is true, the only thing she could even think of in recent time is this vintage coffee maker we have, the dye on the decals started to wipe off, bear in mind it’s over 40 years old and while she says it must be from me cleaning carelessly and spraying it with soap, I think the dye just became unstable after half a century. Things like this. I don’t think I am because it was a real accident and I didn’t mean to., though I accept I need to be more careful and will double check from now on. AITA for forgetting to check my pockets?

I also wanted to add I am self employed and currently also working so I’m BIG tired

I make a lot of little mistakes that are a grievance to my wife, I forgot a Kleenex in my pocket with some craft paint on it that was subsequently washed and stained a few things. AITA for forgetting to check my pockets?",0,Male,genderbent
"I am currently 5 months pregnant with a surprise baby who is very much wanted by myself (27m) and my wife (30f). This is quite light-hearted now, I think I am in the right but would like to see Reddit’s opinion!

We really struggled with choosing baby names, I had big lists that I would read off and my wife would just shut them down with barely a thought. She also did not contribute any names of her own. I was also really sick from about 3 weeks of this pregnancy with hyperemesis, ended up in hospital and I’m still on a load of tablets now. So the stress and hurt of all the names I liked being shot down wasn’t helping!

Anyway, we found out our baby is a girl and we decided on a name, she didn’t like this name originally (she didn’t like any!!) but said she had come round to it and liked it now! So that was that, we referred to her as that name and told our parents and everyone was happy.

Then one evening weeks later, after visiting her (JustNo) parents, she announced she suddenly didn’t like the name. I said well it’s obvious your dad has made some sort of shitty comment (standard) and you’ve taken it to heart. She denied that and just said she had changed her mind (again standard protecting her JustNos). I said I don’t think I can go through the stress of having a million names shot down again and honestly I know her as that name now and it would be hard to change it. Maybe it’s different because I can feel her moving around all the time and I’m more connected to her?

She said she would suggest names, the one she did suggest was so similar to the one she didn’t like! Think ‘Lottie’ and ‘Dottie’ in terms of similarity.

So I said no. You were happy with this name for weeks and weeks, it took us ages to find it and I’m not going through it again. This is the name we have chosen and we’re sticking to it.

So Reddit tell me. I’ve given up my life for this pregnancy, I love her so much already but I was bedbound for weeks and still can’t do anywhere near my usual level of study, work and hobbies. I’m not complaining but AITA for putting my foot down on this one thing?",0,Male,genderbent
"""I (28M) and my wife (29F) met in college and have been married for 6 years. My wife was raised in a strict evangelical household but broke away from those beliefs around the time we met. We had what I thought was a very happy marriage until my wife's father passed away in early 2021 (he received a cancer diagnosis and was gone a few weeks later). My wife was and is, very understandably, completely devastated - she had remained very close to her father, despite no longer following the religious beliefs of her childhood.

My wife decided to honor her father's memory by rejoining her church. Unfortunately, it is one of those churches that forbids many things I find fun and relatively harmless and classifies them as ""addictions"" or ""tools of Satan."" For example, before her father's passing my wife and I enjoyed having a glass of wine or cocktail now and then (maybe a couple times a week) and also enjoyed weed or edibles (legally) once every month or two. But after joining the church my wife decided she was an alcoholic and drug addict. She also decided that her occasional porn use (we enjoyed it together to spice things up now and then) was also an ""addiction."" She is now insisting that I am also an addict because I don't want to give all these things up. I tried to meet her halfway - I don't care about weed and am fine never using again, and agreed not to drink at home if my wife truly wanted to have a sober household, but said I would still want to have an occasional drink when out with friends. I will admit I like (written) erotica, which she never thought was a problem until she became religious. She also threw away my vibrator saying it was an instrument of the Devil.

The latest is that my wife's pastor told her video games (all games, not just M rated ones) are sinful and now my wife is insisting I have a video game addiction and need treatment. Gaming is a main hobby for me, probably around 8-10 hours a week. It's not an addiction in my view, just something I really enjoy! I work full-time, cook, clean, exercise, etc. I'm not neglecting anything else in my life (except respect for my wife's new beliefs, I guess) by gaming.

My wife wants me to start going to church with her. She says she will go to couples counseling but only through her church, not to a secular counselor. I told her that I understand she is grieving and struggling and I want to be kind and supportive, and if it really helps we can keep alcohol and weed out of the house, but I am not going to become an evangelical (unlike her, I was raised with atheist parents) and am not going to restrict myself to activities she finds acceptable under her religious beliefs. I also asked her to please stop labeling habits she doesn't like as ""addiction."" Of course she now thinks I am an AH for being mean to her while she is grieving. Most of our family members and friends also think I should do what she asks in the name of being supportive. So, AITA?""",0,Male,genderbent

"We have renovations going on in our basement and a lot of different trade has been coming through. At times, some of the trade has asked to use our washroom upstairs. My husband (f35) is not comfortable with that due to COVID precautions and hygiene. We have two young kids as well. A little bit of background, my husband has a hard time using public washrooms and if we stay at a hotel, it takes her a good two to three days for her to get comfortable enough to go number two. 
I have asked my wife (m37) not to allow anyone to use the washroom due to the above mentioned reasons and due to the fact that it is not up to us to accommodate everyone. Wife feels I am being “inhuman” and continues to allow everyone to use the washroom.

Update :Just to clarify a few things .This is a walk out basement with a separate entrance . For all the people asking why I would get renovations if I was worried about Covid. 
Secondly before the basement got demolished, there was a washroom the demolition crew had access to. Obviously that’s gone. 
Then we had the framing crew come in for two weeks and didn’t ask to use the washroom. They did their own thing.
And them completely different experience with the next set of crew.

"""My (m25) girlfriend (f30) is very luxurious when it comes to bathing. We are talking hour (+) long showers, baths with oils, when she has a bath she always has a shower after, running the tap while shaving. She also soaks through the bath mat every time. I’ve bought my own mat now so that I don’t have to deal with that horrible wet feet feeling. 

I am the total opposite, partly from the way I was raised (quick showers, had a time limit, bath or shower not both). I also know that water doesn’t grow on trees and I am anxious about bills. Im on a student loan right now looking for work and she is looking for work. We don’t have any money coming in. 

We have no hot water at the moment but we do have an electric shower so can attain hot water that way. Im very worried about money, my card got declined yesterday.

My partner has decided she wants to have a bath and fills it up using the electric shower, topping it up with kettle water. This is making me anxious, I think it is a painfully slow, wasteful process and we should just stick to showers for now (no longer than 15 minutes at that).

I’ve brought this up with my partner. She adamantly refused. She said the shower to run the bath runs just as long as her shower would. Im not so sure, plus with the kettle that’s more usage.

She says she doesn’t want to shower like me (quickly) but personally I think you can have a thorough wash in fifteen minutes or less. 

I also find my partner hypocritical, she engages with the eco warrior crowd- I’m not so sure any of this is “eco”. 

I told her if this continues I will put the bill in her name. She said good luck with that I don’t have any money. I said neither do I, in fact you owe me  £500+. She called me an asshole, that I’ve ruined the whole day and said its not fair.

"

I (27f) live with my boyfriend of six years (24m) in a 1 BR apartment. He's generally very extroverted and I'm a little more shy. 

Recently we've had two fights related to unexpected overnight guests. The first time, my BF announced that one of his friends was going to stay the night on our floor/couch because he was in town, didn't have anywhere to stay, and didn't want to pay for an Airbnb. I like a lot of his friends, but this particular friend is somewhat inconsiderate and annoying IMO. I've discussed not getting along with this friend with my BF before, so I told him that I think he shouldn't have invited him, or really anyone, to stay with us without discussing it with me first. He said he basically couldn't imagine saying “no” to a friend looking for a place to stay, and that I put him in an uncomfortable position if he has to say no to a friend. We argued about it some, but in the end the friend came. He was inconsiderate as usual, but nothing catastrophic.

Then a couple days ago, my BF, I, and another friend of ours went on a weekend trip and stayed in an AirBnB together. A couple days before the trip, BF asked whether I would mind if two of his other friends met up with us during the trip. I said sure, as long as they don't stay in our AirBnB, which is only supposed to host 3 people and is pretty small. BF said great, they'll get a hotel or sleep in their car. The trip rolls around, the friends come over to our AirBnB for dinner, and then ask if they can stay with us since they haven't booked a hotel. I don't know these friends very well and didn't want them coming away from this trip hating me for depriving them of a place to stay, so I don't respond and wait for BF to say that we'd rather they get their own accommodations since it's very crowded. Instead, he just cheerily says “sure!” and starts planning evening activities for us. I don't say anything, and the friends stay over.

The next day, I told my BF I thought it was disrespectful that he invited these people to stay the night in our AirBnB after (a) I had already told him I really didn't want them staying over, and (b) we had a big discussion about not unilaterally inviting guests to our shared spaces last month. BF responded that I shouldn't put him in this position vis a vis his friends, and that he just can't empathize with me ever not wanting his friends over, since he'd be fine with my friends staying over if they wanted. I haven't invited my friends to stay over much, because I just value my personal space (and we don't have a guest room or anything), but whenever they've come over for lunch or something, I've checked with him first. All of these friends are relatively rich also, so it's not as though they would be homeless if we didn't host them.

"""My boyfriend can be blunt sometimes. Tonight I was talking about something that happened in a sporting event I was watching. Part way through, he suddenly said 'I really don't care about this at all.'

His delivery was quite rude which was what affected me. I explained how I felt and asked that he just pretend to be interested in something that interests me for the few minutes that I talk about it.

He got mad at me and said that under no circumstances will he lie. He also got really mad that I used the word 'pretend'. (He very rarely talks about these subjects anyway).

I don't ask or expect him to share in these interests, I just want to talk about them sometimes when we talk about how our days went.

I explained to him that when he talks about things that I don't care about, (mainly politics) I always listen to him and ask questions (even though I don't care at all about politics), because he is important to me and I can see that he enjoys the topic.

"""So, bit of backstory. Me (21M) and my girlfriend (21F) have only been together for 2 and a half months. Before we met she was very much a mother's girl, never had to work and she very much wrapped me up in cotton wool. She had never had a job or even access to her own bank account. Then I came along. We connected instantly and within 4 weeks we were living together with my mom. He was the one who suggested this as she lives roughly an hour from where she was living so she was spending about 3/4 days a week there and commuting to work. He offered for her to move in (rent free, she just had to pay for her own food shopping) and save the money she was paying for rent and put it in savings for when we move out. We all agreed to this and she moved in 6 weeks ago. Since then they have helped my girlfriend find a well paying job, helped her get access to her bank account and taught her how to pay her phone bill. Also, she has paid for new furniture for in her/our room as I only had under bed storage as this was not enough for both of our belongings. 

So since moving in my mother hardly speaks to me. Whenever she is asking one of us about something, she asks her, even if asking about something specific to me (my work schedule, my car, etc), she will just help herself to food in the fridge that she has obviously bought for our meals and has asked my girlfriend to start paying rent (£50 a week) as since she started working she is no longer able to claim universal credit (which I was getting and using as 'rent'). My girlfriend agreed to this as she is still paying significantly less than she was when renting her own place.

However, although she helps with general cleaning around the house and maintain a level of tidiness to our room, it is not up to my mother's standard. She works 60+ hours a week and I work 40 so between us we are hardly ever home. My mother however does not work and deep cleans every day. Today she came into our room and kicked off about the state it was in (typical mom ""your room is a pig stye"" type comments) which it was not. She said she is unable to bleach the surfaces in our room because there is stuff on them and when she clears them off we always end up putting it back. My girlfriend has told her she is not comfortable with her moving her things as everything has a place and she decides to rearrange them as she sees fit, also she paid for the furniture we're using so she does not need to clean it as it does not bother my girlfriend or me. My mother decided to tell her that if she does not start helping around the house and stop telling her what she can and can't eat in her own home then she will kick her out. My girlfriend has told her she cannot just threaten to kick her out as she pays her rent and is entitled to ask her to leave her stuff alone. She has now gone out and not been home all day. I am mad at my girlfriend saying she should've just agreed to do it because it's my mom's house.

"I am a 29 year old autistic male. I've had several great relationships, but they always end because I don't want kids.

I'm the type of person who happily helps others in an emergency. I can fix your computer or car, give rides or food. I can help you solve problems logically.

But I cannot provide emotional support. I'm not saying it's bad for people to want it. I'm just not the person who can give you that. I like to solve problems. When someone just wants to complain about a problem, and tells me not to try to solve it, that it can't be solved, it does something bad to my brain. It gives me anxiety and I've even had meltdowns because of it.

I don't complain and I also don't require emotional support and I never have in my entire life. In fact, my parents took me to be evaluated in the first place because I'd fall and get injured but not cry or react at all.

When someone pours out anxiety to me, I just soak up their anxiety and my brain can't deal, if they don't leave me alone then a panic attack can come on and I've had ones that took days to recover from.

Lately I've somehow ended up on dates with girls that just want to complain to me. Once I'm a captive audience in the pub they just pour out everything wrong with their life, the world, their job, or things they hate, or what gives them anxiety.

If I didn't enjoy a date I thank the person for their time and tell them I didn't feel a connection and wish them good luck. I do this because many girls complain about ghosting and having their time wasted. They usually ask why and I always tell them the honest reason, and they always get angry. But I didn't know what else to do.

Recently a friend set me up with a girl. I don't know why he set me up with her when he KNOWS I don't provide emotional support. There was cable news playing in the pub. The girl was staring at the news like a zombie, and kept anxiously saying she felt like the whole world was coming apart.

I DESPISE cable news since it just works people into agitated states on purpose and manipulates their emotions. They ALL do. I told the girl the news was upsetting her so let's go somewhere else. She said very pompously, ""Well, SOME people could turn their back and ignore these issues, but I'm not one of these people.""

I do not turn my back and ignore issues. I am very informed and spend most of every weekend volunteering in the community. What I don't do is sit and stare at a TV and whine hopelessly in a pub. Instead I take action.

I told her we could leave the pub and do a volunteer activity right then (Saturday afternoon) to make the world better. She said ""Welllll we'll never be able to fix all of it, whatever we do will be pointless.""

The cable news was starting to give me a bad feeling so I ended the date right there and said it would not work out. She asked why so I told her why.

My friend called me up later furious and told me I was an asshole and can't talk to people like that and being autistic is not a good reason.",0,Male,genderbent

Our toddler wanted to go with her so she ended up going to the supermarket instead and asked if I wanted her to get me an ice cream bar. I said no thanks. She asked again, specifically about an ice cream bar and again I said no. There is a pint of gelato that we both love at our supermarket so I asked if she would be that, and thanked her. She came home a few minutes later with an ice cream bar and was surprised / annoyed when I said I didn’t want it. She said she tried to do something nice and I don’t appreciate it. I said I did appreciate when she offered, but I said no TWICE to wanting an ice cream bar. It’s ridiculous of her to have thought I would be so happy that she came home with exactly the thing I said I didn’t want.

Edit: she bought the same flavor as the gelato that I wanted, so she thought she was right. Except it was still in the form of an ice cream bar that I didn’t want…",0,Male,genderbent
"Hi, I am 25(m) married to 35(f) for 6 years. We live in a major city in an older apartment building. Like most cities and most apartments our building can have issues with various pests. Something I wasn’t familiar with until I moved here. In the time we’ve lived in this unit (5 years) we’ve had two infestations of two different pests, one of which left me with severe anxiety bordering on ptsd (hesitation to say this as I don’t mean to diminish the term but I found it highly traumatizing). I keep the house fastidiously clean out of caution so as to make it unappealing to bugs that eat scraps. My wife opened our dishwasher today and unfortunately saw a roach. She told me and I suddenly felt that hot panic rising up in me, I started immediately checking the kitchen for weak spots and laying down traps and borax under appliances. We recently got a new pet and I was googling how to prevent roaches from being attracted to their food. So my wife begins to try and show me something as I’m reading and I guess I didn’t give it enough response so she started to flip out. She started yelling at me that I was in a “fugue” state and told me to get it together. She called me a child and said that I needed to handle myself better. When I said that yelling at me wouldn’t help my anxiety it made it worse. She monologued along these lines well past the point of my being in tears and then left the room entirely. Now she’s not speaking to me basically. She blames me for the first infestation we got when we first moved in (she says I didn’t rinse the dishes well enough and it caused it, I had never had a dishwasher before and this was probably true but I had no idea, it was really upsetting and since then I’m very careful), she says she “can’t be married to a child” and she “needs to be able to tell me things without me breaking down”. I feel this is unfair as generally speaking I’ve done a tremendous amount of work to manage my anxiety and my (diagnosed) OCD. She didn’t want me getting therapy in our early relationship so I’ve literally done all the CBT work on my own with books and online courses etc. So I don’t want it to seem like I’m non functional. I hold down a full time job and care for 3 children from home, I’m doing my best. I didn’t get mad or say anything back when she was angry except that yelling wouldn’t help and I was sorry. We have a newborn baby and my anxiety about pests is also heightened because I’m terrified of her getting sick.

TLDR: have had pests and the experience was difficult on me, I am sensitive to the possibility of it happening again and if I see a sign of pests I do extra cleaning etc to try and nip it in the bud. Wife calls my anxiety a “fugue” state and yelled at me for it.

So AITA?",0,Male,genderbent
"Edit: I am the AH. I accept it, you pointed it out clearly. I will solve this mess myself. Though I also want to thank some people who gave me useful explanations and who understood my situation. However, you are overall right, it was illegal and stupid. 


My girlfriend ""Alex"" and I are together for over 3 years now. She is 21 now, I am 19.

Two years ago we moved together, but only my name was on the lease. In my country (Not USA), if you own a TV or radio that receives channels, you have to pay broadcasting fees. A (shitty) company is responsible for it and if they know you are watching TV without paying them, they can send the police to force you to pay. It sounds hard, but it actually never comes to that point. Some people even get away with lying and never paying this company.

Anyway, we were living in this apartment alone for the first time without our parents. One evening when I was alone, a man knocked on the door. He was from the company and he wants me to sign something.

This is the point where I was the A-hole. Me, being very anxious and having low self-esteem, signed it stupidly in Alex's name.

She was very angry of course. I didn't blame her for that, it was my fault.

But I blame her for holding it over my head for the last two years every now and then when she has to pay those fees. The thing is, one year ago, she payed an electric store to built out the receiver, therefore the TV becomes a screen and you cannot watch TV channels anymore. However, you have to cancel the fees on your own.

She never did that and often forgot to pay the fees on time, so she had to pay more. It got to the point where she has to pay 3x the amount and if she doesn't pay on time now, it will have serious consequences.

Last month she was angry again over it and said: ""It's your fault, you have to cancel it!"". I did it per mail, but there was no confirmation mail and she did receive a letter to pay for this month, even though it should be canceled. Now I should call this company and need to solve this.

It makes me mad when she gets angry about it and blames me, but in my opinion she is still responsible for the payments and if she missed the deadlines, it is her fault that she has to pay more. She could have canceled it herself over a year ago, but she just kept postponing it.

I learned my lesson the hard way, I am much more considered of my choices and will never ever sign something in another person's name. It could have been worse, but in my opinion, it was something she should have been doing anyway.

AITA still for being responsible for her broadcasting fees even though she could have canceled it herself?",1,Male,genderbent
"""My bf (25M) and I (24F) have been living together for over 5 years and are in a committed relationship. I recently starting working at a large company that offers amazing benefits including free health care for employees. My bf works at a restaurant and is not offered health insurance as he is considered part time. He currently has health insurance covered by his parents but he will no longer be eligible to stay under his parent’s plan after EOY.
Today he asked me to put him under my employer’s plan because it’s “free.” My employer offers free health insurance for just employees. Adding dependents to this plan will increase my biweekly payment from $0 to $300. His first response to me showing him the rate increase was “that’s fine, we’ll each pay half then.” I laughed in shock and told him that was not fair, since I was paying nothing and would now have to pay half of HIS insurance. He immediately started to yell at me after I said that. Once our emotions had calmed down, we pretty much just tabled the discussion for another time.
For some reference here, we both split everything living-wise 50/50ish. He makes more than me so he pays for the more expensive utilities and all food/entertainment. But I don’t think it’s fair to pay for his health insurance especially when we aren’t living lavishly. I have tons of debt I’m working to get rid of and losing $300 a month will heavily impact my finances. Am I the asshole here for not adding him to my plan?""",0,Female,genderbent
"""My wife has diabetes and a slew of other health issues. She wanted a dog and promised she would walk the dog but actually never does, and when she does she complains the entire way. Every time we go out she complains and wants to go home to game. She also has a mountain of credit card debt and has been asking me to cover her.

A majority of the housework is done by me and she often complains whenever she has to do anything or go anywhere.

Yesterday we took the dog out to the dog park and once again she complained the entire time. The dog vomited in the car and I said I would clean it up. She wanted to just go home and game, I said I would go home wash the dog clean the vomit and make dinner. Once we got home I asked her for the car keys after bathing the dog and she ignored me so I messaged her and she still ignored even though WhatsApp said she was online… so I ran into her room in anger and said she is so useless. Apparently she was on discord with two other gamers and felt embarrassed. I told her I wasn’t aware since she wasn’t talking.

She ran downstairs and swore and yelled at me and threw my shoes at me and continued to yell for another twenty minutes. She proceeded to tell me to call my friends so that she could also call me useless. Which I didn’t do… then I told her she’s crazy and told her I’m going to record what she’s doing… she tried to break my phone and threw some more stuff on the floor. Then forced me to apologize.

"""My(30F) husband(26M) is a disaster in the kitchen. He leaves a huge mess behind after he's done with cooking. He uses a zillion utensils even to make a coffee(don't ask me how, it's an unsolved mystery). 
Today, he said he learnt this new recipe from his dad and went into the kitchen to prepare it. When He was done it turned out to be vodka pasta. It tasted horrible because he added an entire bottle of vodka. He also put too much salt and it ended up tasting like salt with pasta on the side rather than pasta seasoned with salt. So I told him to make whatever he wants only for himself and never for me and also to clean up the kitchen after he's done cooking. 

To add, I've always cooked for us ever since we got married. I don't even mind cooking for him. He has no reason to cook for both of us. He says he wants to learn to cook. So I told him to make himself food and I'll taste a bit to tell him where he could do better. 

AITA?

Edit : I work as a chef at a restaurant and I work nearly 12 hours a day. So I have just enough time to get as much work done as possible at home and then go to sleep. When my husband cooks, the food turns out to be inedible and it ends up in the trash. Then, I have to clean up, cook again and them clean up once again. So it's so much work for me. He refuses to go to a cooking class too. I don't have time to for and teach him.

Edit 2: He boiled the pasta in vodka and water. Then he made the sauce with more vodka. His logic was that since vodka is one of the important ingredients, adding more of it would make it taste better than the given recipe. He didn't realize that vodka makes food bitter when added in large quantities.""",0,Female,genderbent

"""My ex BF and I were together for 8 years. We broke up when we were 23. That was 5 years ago. Part of the reason we broke up was cause I just wasn’t good at life. If that makes sense. After HS I enlisted in the army. Did 3 years, and then just sort of laid around the house until he broke up with me 2 years later at 23. 

He ended up becoming a special sort of nurse I guess. Well when he left me I honestly took his words kind of personal. Even though they were 7 years ago. Hearing him call me a failure at life hurt. He did everything he could to help me. And had decided I wasn’t, “worth saving”. It did inspire me to go to rehab and get my life back on track though.

He apparently got fired for something related to not getting a vaccine (won’t get into that since I think it’s against the rules). We’re Facebook friends, and he messaged me. Asking me if I wanted to go out for dinner. I said no originally. But he talked me into it. And I thought wow, things were really turning around for me. It started out with a little bit for groceries, and it’s gotten to where I’m paying his rent despite not living with him. I told him I had to stop since I felt like he was just using me. 

But he brought up the fact that he urged me to go to rehab, and all the other stuff that he did for me (helping me graduate among other things). And he’s right, I do owe him.

"

I have been living with my partner since shortly before the start of the pandemic (February 2020), when we got together we decided to help each other with housework, although he would do most of it because I work from 7am to 5pm ... the problems started when he realized that I am a casual gamer, normally he played an hour an hour and a half, of course, after doing what he should do and after spending time with me (I clarify the last thing because later it will be important, not that he sees it as an obligation"").

Well, this was a huge problem for him because I was ""wasting the time"" that could be happening with him, we talked about it and then we agreed that he would relax and play days in between, so although it did not seem fair to him, he also had to take into account that he was alone at home all day and due to depression problems that he is treating...

After a few days with that system, when it was his ""play day"" I began to do the law of ice after his session, visually annoying. When talking to him about this, he told me that he was always alone and that I should pay more attention to him and not to something so stupid. Well, he stopped playing for a long time because he did not want problems, he played once a week, on weekends, because even if it bothered me, then he would convince me to do something together to ""compensate."" Until he got enough money to improve his PC, with this he wanted to play the games that before he could not due to requirements and he also got a group of friends on Discord, with whom he always canceled because he did not have a mic or a good and clear PC. The problems returned, but much worse, with the same excuse that he does not give enough attention, although we have never stopped spending time together, only that according to him, it is not enough. This has been wearing me down all this time, the fact of not being able to do something that he always did and wanted, or feel bad doing it... And in the last few weeks, I presented him with a game that can now be played on his PC and he spends all day playing. I thought that this would change his perspective of the games, but guess what, it keeps bothering me that he spends 1 hour or 1 hour and a half playing, and when he quits, I play again... I don't know how to feel anymore. He has been asking me if I still love him, if I still want to be with him, and the truth is that I feel very confused and worn out with everything. I still love him, I still want him to be well, but everything indicates that he does not accept that part of my life and what it has to do with it. am I the asshole?",0,Female,genderbent

"""(throw away bc my gf knows my main and is mad at me over this. UPDATE at bottom)

Me (24M) and my girlfriend (22F) have known each other since middle school, we went to different high schools but stayed in touch and started dating about three years ago. We had a break for a while, and recently got back together.

I normally don’t care what my girlfriend does in her spare time, as long as she pays some attention to me. Now my issue comes in when my girlfriend’s best friend (imma call her ‘Kia’(21F)). Kia and my girlfriend are super close, they met in high school and bonded quickly over their love of gaming and art. Also, they stuck together because they were a few of the only lgbt kids in the school (Kia is ‘gay’ and my girlfriend is bi).

Anyway Kia and her roommate are having issues, she’s looking for somewhere else to move to, but it has gotten to a point where she ‘doesnt feel safe’ staying there anymore. My girlfriend jumped at the chance to let Kia stay with her while she looked for somewhere else. I wasn’t too thrilled but me and my girlfriend don’t live together so I didn’t feel like I had a say.

Today I came over to hang with my girlfriend and of course, Kia was there. I don’t really know her so I kinda ignored and blanked her. Girlfriend was still in the shower so I went to get myself a drink. I was surprised to find a lot of sweet stuff and candy in the fridge and kitchen bc my girlfriend isn’t the biggest sweet fan.

When my girlfriend got out of the shower I asked her about it and she told me that Kia has a really big sweet tooth (wouldn’t have guessed bc she’s in great shape) so my girlfriend brought some of her faves. I felt kinda hurt bc she has never gotten my fave snacks just because. Tbh I also don’t like how close they are, I’ve walked in on them kinda cuddling while playing games and stuff, and just some other comments make me uncomfortable around Kia.

I told my girlfriend this, that I didn’t like being around Kia and honestly, I didn’t like her being around Kia. well Kia heard this, and she ended up going back to her roommate, telling my girlfriend she didn’t want her and me to fight and that she would just try and stick it out for a few more weeks. Now my girlfriend is pissed at me and is begging Kia to come back because she’ really worries about her safety’. That made me feel kinda bad but I was just voicing my concerns and now feel like I’ve been ignored and that she is prioritizing Kia over me. So AITA?

Edit: ok so I talked to my girlfriend. I point-blank asked her if she had feelings for Kia. she went quiet for a few seconds before admitting that she does. she promises that nothing had happened between them, but she has some strong feelings for Kia. she said she's felt super guilty and it had been eating away at her. I told her that it would be best if we didn't continue our relationship, she agreed, she told me she still considers me one of the most important people in her life and hopes we can still be friends at one point. I don't know how to feel, I know I can't blame Kia, and I know my girlfriend didn't cheat but I still feel awful.

I also found out the actual reason Kia didn't want to stay with her roommate anymore and it made me sick. I told my girlfriend to bring Kia back asap. i cant say bc of posting rules but I feel fucking awful about making her feel like she had to go back.""",1,Male,genderbent

"""Title sounds awful but here’s my story: I (F26) started dating Liam (M24) about 10 months ago our relationship started very casually and little by little became a bit more serious, but we’re still not in the “I love you” part.

Early in our relationship we developed a very weir dynamic, when he wanted a compliment, he would say something bad about himself and I then would tell him he’s handsome and that there’s nothing wrong with him for example, he would say his hair looks awful and he whishes he had silkier hair, then I’d tell him about how handsome his hair and hairstyle is. 

Around mid-September we were hanging out at my house when he found a pic I had with my last ex, I wasn’t keeping that pic for any particular reason it’s just a regular photo of the two of us hugging and I had forgotten it was there (Liam founded it in an old notebook). He got a bit angry and demanded to know if I still had feelings for him, I told him no and we discarded the photo however Liam was still angry and started making snide comments about how (in his own words) “I probably still miss having my super fit ex in my life”.

Now I’m afraid of making this sound more misandrist that it is until now so I’ll be brief: Yes, my ex was more fit than Liam, no, it doesn’t make any difference to me and wouldn’t date anyone based on their physique alone. I do have my preferences but it's still not something that definitive. 

Anyway after this incident he would constantly say he “wished he had a better physique” so that he could make me happy, I of course would tell him he is great the way he is and that I love his body but after a month of hearing this daily or sometimes twice a day I started getting annoyed and yesterday I told him that if he felt so strong about it he should just get plastic surgery, then silence, he didn’t argue and just left.

"Hello, throwaway account here. Lemme give you all some backstory and info.

I (M24) had a girlfriend (F25, ""Zack"") and a best friend (M20, ""Bella""). He was friends with me for 7 years, and among those years I met Zack and we got together. At first they didn't get along but eventually they became friends as well.

Zack and I were together for 5 years and everything seemed to be fine. One day (around December last year) she called me and said she wanted to break up.

It was traumatic, but ultimately I agreed, can't do much if someone doesn't love you anymore. I tried to be civil and remain friends with her but only 2 weeks after that, she told me she was asking Bella to date her, and he agreed. To not make things long, they were already on the talks and that was her reason to leave me. I couldn't just take that, so I went no-contact with them.

Life went on, few months back I got to begin a relationship with a wonderful guy and everything seemed to be nice again.

Now, Zack is one to make very personal gifts. I am very masculine in my looks, as in, baggy and male clothing is about 80% of my closet, so she got used to giving me her clothes when they didn't fit her anymore. I would wear them not only as some sign of love but because I really liked her style. Since I'm a petite man, I didn't grow that much since those days, so the items she gave me still fit me and I still use them. For now, I not only relate them to her but to me and all the things I lived while wearing those clothes.

Back to the story and why I might be an asshole: last week I uploaded some pictures to my Instagram, wearing a hoodie she gave me and I love very much. I got all the usual comments that I look good, doing well and such, and suddenly, Bella shoots me a DM telling me I'm a whore and I should stop trying to get his girlfriend back (I haven't talked to any of them in over nine months, and whenever I talk about them I either tell the story of the break-up or straight up say I don't want to hear about them). I asked what was his deal and he told me I should get rid of the clothes she gave me, and any gifts she made by the way, and give them back to her so she can choose what to do.

I basically told him to fuck off and took screenshots to send her, since he's prone to take things out of context when telling stories, I didn't want to let him make it as if I was attacking him for no reason. She didn't reply, but he kept insulting me and demanding I get rid of my stuff, and eventually reached out to mutuals when I blocked him.

Some of those mutuals say I should indeed get rid of the things, my boyfriend and others say I should do whatever fits my desires, and I personally don't want to lose my stuff just because I happen to not be dating that person anymore. I expressed that and many people seem to believe I'm being childish and doing it just to spite him.

So, as much as I don't really think it's asshole-ish to want to keep my things... Am I the asshole?",0,Male,genderbent
"""My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year. She's not one to wear perfume or after shave and she barely wears any deodorant (she only puts it on before work). I love wearing perfumes, creams, and mists, and overall just smelling good. I have a sensitive nose and I'm very aware of scents (good or bad) around me so I try my best to stay smelling good, mostly for my own sake. I even had my armpits lasered so they wouldn't stink. I don't mind that she doesn't do the same as long as she doesn't smell bad.

However, lately I've been having a hard time being around her. I'm no longer interested in sex or even cuddling because her armpit odor is so strong it honestly makes me nauseous. For the past couple of months, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to change this. I tried perfuming her clothes, asking her to try on a new fragrance I got, and giving her massages with a nice smelling bar but those were all short time solutions that only masked the smell so I figured I should just tell her.

One night before going to bed I asked her if she could wear some deodorant. She looked shocked and told me I was rude. She said I didn't smell so good either and that people couldn't smell their own sweat (which ofc is bullshit because I can smell mine). I insisted I didn't mean to offend her but she was weird about it so I decided to just drop it when she put it on. She kept on going about how rude it was asking someone to put on deodorant and I felt bad about it.

Thing is, that was just another short term solution. She also uses shirts several times before washing them, which would be fine if she didn't leave them stinking, but whenever she's close to me I just want to run away. I don't want to make her feel bad but I can't take it anymore. It makes me uncomfortable and sometimes I avoid physical contact for this reason but I obviously don't want to break up over something so dumb. I know it's probably my issue because it only seems to bother me, but I don't know what else to do. I thought about buying her a perfume and deodorant set or something similar but I don't want to offend her. WIBTA if I asked her (again) to wear deodorant more often?""

"""My wife works overseas. She arrived home for fall break 3 days ago. I knew something was off when she arrived. She has a short temper and can sometimes be overly critical. She asked how I was doing and I said I was feeling a little sad and isolated (being home alone without her) and I really opened up to her about how I was feeling, not that I wanted her to fix anything, just that I wanted to feel heard and understood. 

Yesterday we went to a museum. Suddenly my best friend started texting me about taking a potential trip and it was obvious that my wife had texted her. She and I communicate regularly, but I felt a little put off that my wife had texted her about my problems without asking me first, since I didn’t think my problems were that big of a deal, and I didn’t want to make a huge issue out of it. After I chatted with her for a few minutes, I told my wife that I didn’t appreciate her contacting my friend without telling me or asking me first. 

She then proceeded to chastise me loudly in the museum (not yelling because it’s a museum/quiet place) but loudly and I walked toward the exit because I felt embarrassed. She then proceeded to follow me and cornered me on the balcony outside and continued to reprimand me for bringing it up. I was sort of in shock, but she wasn’t stopping so I told her to stop following me and to leave me alone. She said no and continued to follow me/block my exit until I made it clear I wanted to be left alone and she gave up and left. 

I then realized I had left my wallet in the car, and she had the keys. I found her and asked her if I could please have the keys to the car so I could get my wallet (I wanted to just sit and have a coffee) and she said no. I begged her with several onlookers feeling humiliated the whole time if I could just please have the keys, that I wasn’t planning on leaving, I just wanted my wallet and she said no and left.

Eventually I just went back to the car and luckily she was just getting back as well. We drove home and eventually got into a huge argument where she blamed the entire episode on me for provoking her, even though my comment about asking her not to contact my friend was literally a one second statement.

"""My ex’s family own a big old house that has some adjoining bedrooms and shared bathrooms. There’s my ex’s bedroom and then an adjoining bedroom which has a shared bathroom. You can access the bathroom from both rooms, and there is also a door connecting the two bedrooms. The doors can only be locked from my ex’s room.

So, my son went on a trip with his mom to visit her grandparents and he ended up getting very sick and kept asking for me. I flew to be with him, and I was staying in the same room as my son. The first few days were fine but then my ex decided to be a jerk.

I told her I was going to have a shower since I didn’t want her to just walk in, and she said it was fine. Yet mid-shower, she still walked in and was acting like it was no big deal since I was taking too long and she had an online meeting she needed to get to in 5 minutes, and she had seen it all before anyway. She also didn’t immediately get out when I told her to, she took her sweet time brushing her teeth before she left.

I didn’t want to say anything in front of our son so it was only after dinner that I could finally speak to her alone. I told her either she sleeps in a different room, or I do. My ex tried to minimize what happened and told me I couldn’t sleep in a different room since our son wouldn’t sleep unless I shared a bed with him, and she wasn’t going to let me kick her out of her own bedroom. She said what happened wouldn’t happen again and that I should shower quicker. I got frustrated and I told her I would just go home with our son if she wasn’t going to move because I wasn’t going to sleep in a room she had access to and we both knew our son wouldn’t stay willingly unless I was here. That was the wrong thing to say because it just escalated things further and led to my ex reminding me that this was her custody time so she got to make the decisions.

"Thanks to careful money management and investing throughout the years, my wife (58F) and I (51M) were both able to leave our corporate jobs recently and move into ""semi-retirement."" In other words we both have part-time work that earns low pay but we enjoy and keeps us busy. At my job, in addition to hourly pay, I go home with about $10-$75 per shift in cash tips, depending on how busy we are. 

Recently I told my wife that I had saved up about $5K in tips and that I would like to use the money to replace the carpet in our home. She was surprised to learn that I had been ""withholding"" my tips. She said she felt bewildered that I seemed to feel my tips were separate income that I had sole discretion over. Her position is that we have always earned and saved jointly and that my tips are no different than any other income. It should go in the bank, just as her paycheck (and mine) goes in the bank. I explained that I enjoy watching the cash add up and since I'm not spending it on myself it's not dishonest. I just like the concept of saving up toward a special ""splurge"" that we didn't already budget for. 

I couldn't help but point out that the other married men that my wife works with all keep and spend their tip money solely at their discretion and most of them spend it on clothes and vacations. I felt that since the carpet is an expense that benefits us both equally that she should have no objection. While ""the other men get to"" is a very poor and childish argument, I can't help but feel a bit ripped off that I don't get to spend my tips as I like. 

Wife, naturally, says ""I don't care what other people do with their tips. We have no precedent in the marriage for money that isn't shared."" I see her point but I also think it's reasonable to earmark my tips for new carpet, which I want more than she does.

I feel bad because when they were talking about the loan, I could have told our mutual not to trust my husband with the money, but instead I basically just said,""You do you, no one likes to listen to my advice"" I decided, instead of the $800 every paycheck, I'm going to give him $700 every paycheck and give the remaining $100 a paycheck to our mutual friend, to help him pay off the loan that my husband talked him into getting, keep in mind, at this point I'm giving him over $3,000 a month at this point, so, am I the asshole?

"Once a year (not last) my family goes to a fancy restaurant. Like a place where steaks are 45+ and sides al a carte. It’s a fun treat for us kids at least, as our parents pay. We all catch up, and we get to try places we never can’t afford ( yet) ourselves.  

So 2019 when we went, my parents invited my fiance's dad as we were newly engaged and he hasn't met everyone.  When invited, his dad expressed he can't afford it, and I told him it's fine cause my parents are paying, its a treat for everyone.  We knew that anyway cause we been helping recently. 

I left absolutely disgusted with his dad. He got 4 whiskey sours, red wine, coke, the most expensive steak, added shrimp and lobster.  Then got 3 sides and dessert. His bill alone was just over $500. Meanwhile, the single highest bill for the other 7 people was $82.

My parents bit the cost and asked me not to complain, they don't want to start anything. My fiance was equally mad and talked to his dad. He tried to say that since they picked the restaurant they can afford it, so it wasn't a big deal. When it was explained that this a once a year thing before! 

Well this year, my mom invited his dad again, despite my no, but not so subtly added a cap to the price point. Well, 20 min or so in the dinner, my fiance's brother and son show up unexpectedly, which pissed me off, but they asked for their own check, so at least they weren't coming for a free meal. 

His brother's card denied. His dad claimed to not bring his wallet. My fiance immediately asked for their check, but my dad being my dad went ahead and paid it. 

Walking out, his brother jokingly asked where we were going next year. His dad said it's just it was a joke, calm down.

My wife has a twin brother named Danielle who was the referred to as the “wild child” and the “bad twin” growing up. 12 days before her 18th birthday, Danielle left to live with an unknown friend. After graduating high school, Danielle planned to attend Purdue university to study special education and allegedly was dropped off by the unknown friend at a greyhound bus station so she could move Lafayette, IN. and attend Purdue. This was the last known time anyone saw her alive. A few years later, Dana’s uncle, who sometimes volunteered at Purdue university, discovered Danielle never attended Purdue. This was a huge red flag because Danielle wanted to go to Purdue since she was a young child. Naturally, our family began to worry that something might’ve happened to Danielle after she left the bus stop but brushed it off because the last thing Danielle said to Dana was “I need time away”. After 10 years, my wife believed that Danielle had passed away because there was no way she would go this long without contacting her. Then in 2017 I recognized a woman who I thought was my wife but was stunned when I realized the woman was actually my wife’s long lost twin. It turned out, Danielle changed her mind about going to Purdue and attended Washington state university instead. She kept it a secret because she didn’t want anyone to know her intentions. She took a cab from the bus stop to the airport and purchased a oneway plane ticket to Washington state where she created a completely new life thousands of miles away from the life she left behind. Danielle said the moment she stepped foot on the plane was one of the happiest moments of her life, she was so happy free from 18 years of toxicity, mental abuse, and lack of support from her family. Danielle said she couldn’t remember the last time she thought about anybody in her family and wishes the best us but has no interest in reuniting with us. At the end of our conversation, I said this Is going to be an adventure explaining to everyone I met you and asked if she had a message for Dana or anyone else. She replied “Fuck them, nothing about me and that family works. Don’t even tell them you met me” I figured if Dana and her family found this out, it would hurt them more then just not knowing what happened to Danielle. Fast forward 3 1/2 years, Dana finally found Danielle on social media and had been talking to her after 23 years apart. I decided to reveal my secret before Dana found out from Danielle.

"Throwaway Account

I (34f) used to be in a relationship with ""Sam"" (35m). We met in middle school, dated on/off in high school, and even talked about marriage in college. This all came to an end when I caught him cheating with my roommate, and we broke up. It was really hard, but it got worse when I found out that he was pregnant.

Immediately I sought him out to confront the possibility of his baby being mine, and Sam avoided me while sending his friends and new girlfriend ""Amy"" (girl he cheated with) after me to stop harassing him. I reached out to his mom explicitly stating that I only wished to know if there was a chance that I was the mother, and after enough persistence, Sam contacted me directly, called me pathetic, that I wasn't the mother, and if I continued, he would call the police. Being a broke 19-year-old, I took him at his word and washed my hands of the situation and transferred to another college and moved on with my life.

Eventually, I met my fiancée ""Michael"" (29m), and we've been very happy together. Before the pandemic, we were supposed to get married, but understandably that got pushed back. Now that restrictions are loosening up, we're moving forward with the plans but have drastically cut down on the number of invites to abide by the venue's safety policy. After completing the list and sending out the invitations, I was recently contacted by ""Emma"" (15f) claiming to be my daughter. Obviously, I didn't take her at her word and asked who her father was, and she said Sam. I told her that before she was born, her dad assured me that I wasn't the mother and asked her why she thought I was. Emma explained that it came out that Sam's wife, Amy, wasn't her bio mom, divorced him, and hasn't spoken to Emma in years.

I agreed to take a maternity test and was shocked that I was her mom. I was pissed because I asked Sam if there was any chance, and he denied it. Michael was surprised but also supportive, and I've been speaking to Emma regularly while also making plans to see her. She saw on social media that Michael and I were planning on getting married in the Spring and wanted to come. Unfortunately, everyone that we've already invited have all RSVPed and made special accommodations to attend our child-free wedding. There's no way Emma can come without Michael and me disinviting someone else, which we feel is rude. I told Emma that while I can't invite her to the wedding, I promise to put together another event so she can meet more people in my family. She seemed understanding, but her paternal grandmother called me up to berate me for not making her a priority now that I'm aware of her existence. AITA?

ETA: Because I keep seeing this

THE VENUE HAS A POLICY ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN ATTEND DUE TO SAFETY. This isn't about fire codes but COVID, not the fact that the wedding is child-free.

ETA 2: Thank you to those suggesting that we explain the situation to our guests to see if anyone would be kind enough to allow Emma to come instead. I will talk to Michael about this, but also reach out to Emma directly since so far, only her grandmother is giving me flack for not inviting her.",0,Female,genderbent

"""I (27F) was in a 2 year relationship with my ex boyfriend (26M). We broke up not too long ago, about 3 months ago. 
For context the covid situation in our area had been pretty serious, so we were forced to stay at home together for a significant portion of the past 1.5 years. Whether it was due to the fact that we were cooped up together or our personalities just didn't match, our relationship deteriorated till it hit rock bottom. Once the vaccines started rolling out and we were able to get out more, and get away from each other, we both realised that it was best for us to break up. 
The apartment was leased in my name, so I stayed and my ex moved out to live with his mother for the time being who lives in the same city until he could find a place of his own. 

A week ago, I was out grocery shopping when I ran into his brother. His brother angrily confronted me for ""abandoning"" his brother and running away from my responsibilties. Clearly flustered I asked for a clarification when he revealed to me that he was 4 MONTHS PREGNANT. 
I immediately left everything and drove up to his mother's place and confronted him. 
Long story short, he found out he was was pregnant shortly after our breakup. His reason for not telling me this was because "" He was heartbroken by our breakup
and he was so hurt that he did not want me to be a part him and HIS baby's life."" This was so confusing to me because we had clearly broken up mutually, and the process had been so smooth, unlike our relationship. 
I angrily retorted that it's not just his baby but OUR baby. This is not the way I imagined having my first kid, but it's gonna be my kid nonetheless, so his feelings about us our irrelevant because I have a right to MY CHILD too. 

Here's the main part: During our conversation he broke out a half empty cigarette pack and lit one up!!!!!! After my initial shock, I asked him to put the cigarette down. He refused. Asked him again, and he refused. Fed up, I snatched the cigarette and ashed it. 
He told me to stop and reached for another cigarette from his box. I snatched the box away and stuck it in my pocket. I told him "" how the hell can you even smoke? Even the stupidest person knows that smoking fucks up the baby and causes complications"" and that's when he said ""you don't have any right to tell me that. Its my body and my kid, I'll do WHATEVER I want !"" 
This devolved into a shouting match before I stormed out. 
His brother later called me and told me I have no right to tell him what to do because we aren't in a relationship anymore. I got similar messages from some of our mutual friends too. 
I believe it's my duty to protect my baby, even if it is against its own father, but am I crossing a line by telling him what he can't do? Does the ""his body his rules"" concept apply here, even though he is endangering our child? 
AITA for not letting him smoke?

Edit 1: Thank you for all the responses. 2 points of information that are relevant
1) Ex used to smoke twice a day max during our relationship, 1 in the morning and 1 at night. Never more never less at least in my knowledge, so does the concept of nicotine shock still apply here? 
2) Based on the timeline he was pregnant before the breakup. Due to lockdown we would basically be with each other every day. So unless he did something with someone for the few hours I was away grocery shopping......then I don't really think he cheated.""",1,Female,genderbent
"""So for some context I'm a 26-year-old lesbian and I just had an argument with my girlfriend over the phone about another argument she had with her friend earlier in the day, which resulted in her hanging up on me. The short of it is a long time friend of hers, who I'll call N., has a little brother who is around 13 who has recently started vaping, and N. occasionally lets her brother vape with her. This pissed my girlfriend off and she basically yelled at her saying that she was enabling him.

To which N. responded that if her brother wants to vape, he will find ways to and she would rather that it be with her than with other kids that she doesn't know.

I tried to take the middle ground as she was describing this to me and said that I thought that both of them were right, it's not a good thing that a 13-year-old boy is vaping, but at the same time, having been 13 once myself, I know that just saying ""drugs are bad"" when both she and N. vape almost every day themselves will be completely counterproductive. It'll just send the message that:

1) You are a hypocrite

Our relationship had a rocky start (he was on drugs, cheating, etc) I ended up going to jail, but when I got out, I straightened up, hardcore. Got clean, held a job, stayed faithful, etc. And I've stuck with it. I've completely changed from what I used to be. 
3 years later, and he still doesn't trust me. He wants my location on when I go places, videos, the works. I've obliged, as he has BPD and I understand it's a pretty sensitive topic. 
My dad has a trip planned, to fly me out to Oklahoma for a few days (I live in Florida), to see my grandma and other family. My grandpa passed away a few months ago, and I know this might be the last time I'm able to see my grandma. 
My boyfriend refuses to let me go. He's upset that he wasn't invited (he's made no effort whatsoever to be involved with my family throughout our relationship) and he says if he can't go, and I go by myself, then we're breaking up. He wants ME to pay for his ticket, if he's even able to go, etc.  End of story. I've pushed away friends, I've declined family functions, to make him comfortable and happy and everything throughout the relationship. But it's gotten me nowhere.

I started back to WFH part-time and it's a lot. Baby doesn't sleep well, and it's only me getting up at night. I said something yesterday about being exhausted and considering cutting back work hours.

This morning, my wife said, ""I have an idea, but I don't think you'll like it."" She said she wanted to take all 3 kids to the party, and that I'd ""get to stay home."" I said no. She asked why, and I said reasons we already decided, plus I'm not interested in being away from the kids for that long. She again asked why. I said it's not safe, and the baby (8 weeks) is too young to be away from me. She called me ""irrational"" and said, ""You want to sleep, I'm trying to get you sleep."" I told her she didn't think I would like the idea so why push it, and she backed off.

I was really bothered about it, so tonight I asked to talk. I said I felt blindsided. It seemed like she changed her mind about the party, but instead of asking to change plans, she came up with a scenario where they would go while framing it as a favor to me. Pressing after I said no and calling me irrational was unfair. I said if she wanted to go, we can discuss making it happen.

She said she didn't blindside me, she just wanted to revisit the discussion. She wanted to get me sleep, and them being near family would allow that. She said that I was assuming the worst of her by accusing her of having ulterior motives. She said ""most"" of my reasons were legitimate, and apologized for calling me irrational. But then she said that not wanting to be away from the baby wasn't reasonable, and she would jump at the chance for a break.

I told her if she wanted to give me sleep, take the kids out for an afternoon. Not wanting to spend multiple days away from my newborn is normal due to hormones and the baby's needs, and that postpartum depression has been triggered by far less. Then she did a 180 and called me irrational again, and told me ""saying that you have a lot of hormones makes you irrational"". I used some choice words and now we're not speaking.

I don't think ITA for not wanting them to go, but she might have a point about me interpreting this as her just wanting to go to the party and disguising it as a favor. So AITA?

If she had said something, maybe I could've invited her to come too or told her to drive by the house and see how many cars were there or something. I also told her to ask any of the people there last night if she doesn't believe me.

It's more confusing because I've spent nights out before at this female friend's house with many of the same friends (it's a friend group I'm part of) and not had this problem. But those other times I came home at 11:30 or 11.

She seems to be fixated on the fact that it was like a few minutes past midnight that I got back. She thinks that married men don't do that and that I should know that.

She's now saying that I can 'sleep with whoever I want' and that we can have an open marriage and be honest with each other when we sleep with other people. I don't think she wants an open marriage she's just saying that's what I want when I've never asked for that.

So- AITA for being a married man who stayed out past midnight? Is this abnormal behavior and I should know better and apologize to her?""

"My (33f) husband (30m) and I are currently at an impasse.

Canadian Thanksgiving is coming up this weekend. My husband is working and can't make it, but I was planning on going. However, plans were recently postponed. It was decided that the gathering would be delayed by a week, when it would also be the birthday weekend of his brother. A double-celebration, if you will. Plus, my husband would be able to make it now. A nice family gathering.

However, the delay caused the day of this gathering to occur on a day that I've been looking forward to for a long time: The DotA 2 International Grand Finals.

For the many who won't know, this is arguably the biggest E-sports tournament in existence, for a video game called DotA (my favorite game). The tournament typically happens annually, however last year's tournament was canceled due to COVID. This means it's been two years since this tournament has taken place, and is something my husband has been massively looking forward to. So much so that he had booked an AirBNB in Romania, where it's hosted, with the full intention of traveling there to view it in person—until the COVID situation in that part of the world became a shitshow, making it unsafe to travel there.

Changing gears, my husband invited a few of his close friends to come over for a few days during that time, so they can all watch the final rounds together. This means a whole lot of DotA for the days leading up to the tournament, along with the tournament Grand Final day itself. For the record, he put these days on our shared calendar a few weeks ago.

Needless to say, he is extremely excited about it all, and when he heard about the change of Thanksgiving plans, he swiftly informed me that he will not be able to attend the rescheduled event. I was disturbed by this and am having a really difficult time understanding how a video game tournament could ever take priority over a family gathering. Especially considering we're both very close with my brother.

The thing is, he's dead-set on watching these finals. If, say, there was a wedding, or a birth, or an emergency, or this wasn't the ultimate day of the ultimate tournament, he would make exceptions. But given this exact context, there's pretty much nothing I could say to convince him not to watch. Hell, even if my verdict here was a unanimous YTA, I still can't see him missing this.

After my initial incredulity around his immovable stance, he begrudgingly relented. But he requested that I make an AITA to get the multi-faceted perspective of Reddit's judgment. (He has read—and approved—of this post and its details prior to me making it).

So Reddit, AITA for skipping Thanksgiving and my brother's birthday, while living my best life nerding out with my friends watching the DotA 2 International Grand Finals???",0,Female,genderbent

"""EDIT: clarification: There's already an ethics complaint percolating against his former therapist. The suit is for damages for both of us with the lions share going to him. His participation in the case is over, he wants the case dropped because it's taking too long and he just wants it to go away

I 33F was with my ex 29M for a four years before we did an oops and found out twins were on the way. Turns out it's less birth control and more birth avoidance. Much further along than usual we had a miscarriage and he spent a few days in the hospital and was understandably devastated. I wasn't in the best shape myself but his doctor strongly recommended he see a therapist to help him work these issues out. 

While he was in therapy we got even worse news after genetic evaluation revealed we likely wouldn't ever be able to bring a child to term. I'm short on details because the doctor who explained it to us made my eyes glaze over, but the jist was us combining genes wasn't a thing that should happen.

Things weren't the same after that, and we started to drift apart. Well, I say we but I mean he for reasons that will shortly become obvious. He kept saying it was a sign and it wasn't meant to be and kept shooting down alternatives I looked into, like an alternate donor or adoption. Eventually he decided he'd had enough and moved home to his parents. I won't lie and say it didn't tear me up even worse and I didn't plead for him to reconsider, but I never ever blamed him. I recall feeling bewildered about what had happened but never thought he acted out of malice.

A month after he's home he calls me in tears and says he made a huge mistake and trusted someone he shouldn't have. Turns out his shrink was manipulating him into leaving me. I know this is what she was after because he didn't clue in until she ASKED HIM OUT ON A DATE three weeks after he'd moved out. Once he stopped thinking of her as a doctor and took a step back he saw what she was doing and felt awful.

He's still my ex despite both of us doing our best to make things work it just wasn't happening. He gave me the information to start the lawsuit and it's been progressing slowly but surely. Recently though he's asked me to drop the suit because he just wants to close the door on this chapter of his life and move on. I'm on the fence about this. It's not just his life that's been ripped apart here, and what's to stop this woman from just doing it again? I don't wish my ex any more pain than he's already endured, but I also don't know that I could live with myself not doing everything in my power to stop this monster.

"Hi everyone! So essentially my situation is that Last night my boyfriend and I had plans to stay in and watch movies and just chill as he would have just had a long day at work doing one of his most difficult shifts while I was writing my dissertation with some university friends. Jokingly he invited them to the pub, not actually expecting them to show up. When I get home he says he invited some of his friends to the pub and invites me to come along. Although apprehensive, I begrudgingly obliged and joined him and his classmates. After about 1 hour my social battery entirely ran out and I just wanted to go home, though I didn't say this out loud, I definitely looked beat. My boyfriend suggests I can leave anytime to go back to my place and not with him, so I say I'll stick it through in hopes we come home and are able to watch our movie.

We end up staying at the pub until close while the whole time I admit, I wasn't trying at all to engage in any conversation as the one person I knew, my boyfriend, had his back to me the entire time. When we leave he tells me he doesn't want to stay together tonight and to go back to my place, in which I try to reason but to no avail. So we both go home and after trying to get a response from him via text for about an hour he texts saying he doesn't want to talk now and wants to talk in the morning, so I give up and sleep.

Once the morning roles around he doesn't text me until I message him 3-4 times asking if he's okay. He responds calling me selfish and that I didn't make an effort and was embarrassed of me for my behaviour and says he wants some time alone.

I do understand where he's coming from but I don't think he's appreciating that I had just worked a 13hr shift and was tired before we even left for the pub. Along with that we had plans to rest that evening. Though I think he may have taken a nuclear option with not wanting to talk to me for a while.

TL;DR:

Went to pub with Boyfriend once he spontaneously made plans after a long tiring day of work and didn't act as socially as he wanted me to.

INFO:

I should clarify, he was really advocating for me to come and said he'd make sure he'd introduce me to his friends, as we've just left a friend group which were heavily involved in drugs etc. Not nice people, so we've been trying to get new friends.",0,Female,genderbent
"""My wife (29F) and I (28M) have been married for a year and are expecting our first child in March 2022. This is my first ever pregnancy and both of our first children. We were both invited to my wife’s cousin’s wedding in Colombia at the end of January 2022 during which I will be 34 weeks pregnant. I immediately said that I wasn’t going to go as it’s too far into the pregnancy and there are other associated dangers and risks with travelling in general, as well as travelling to Colombia. I told my wife many times that I did not want her to go either as I’m nervous about delivering early or having any complications and I asked her to support me in that decision and think of another way we could support her cousin besides being at the wedding. My wife decided to book the trip for herself anyway for 5 days during the wedding and said that “this is what [she] decided and what [she is] doing and that’s that.” She believes that I am being irrational and paranoid and equates her leaving the country (we live in Canada) to go to Colombia as the same as her working out of town (she works 6 hours away on a 2 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule). She and this cousin are very close “like sisters” and my wife is supposed to be in the wedding party but was replaced quickly when we initially were not going. She feels that she should go because she’s in the wedding party but I feel like she is choosing her cousin and the wedding over me and our baby. Am I the asshole for being upset with her for going to the wedding?

Edited to add: sorry I should clarify that the wedding is in Colombia, South America. Also my wife and I are not Colombian, and neither is her cousin.

"""My girlfriend and I have been together for five years and have been living together for three. We love each other very much, but a recurring subject is that she feels I don't trust her or ""respect her"" to get certain things done. Truth is, she's right. I don't!

I feel awful for admitting that, but she hasn't shown me that she's capable of it. For example, she cracked my car side mirror and has been saying ever since that she'll fix it herself, but it's been over two years and nothing. A few weeks ago she accidentally pulled down one side of the blinds in our bedroom, but propped it back up in the drywall hoping I wouldn't notice. When I did, I pointed out that if we leave it like that, it's going to keep dragging at the drywall and make the holes bigger and harder to fix. She said she'll fix it, then got mad at me when I said ""Are you sure you'll do it? I'll fix it myself right now if not."" She insisted she would do it and said that I should trust her, but fast forward weeks later, and nothing's been done. On a more serious note, she got an extension to do her taxes this year because she waited so long the first time around, and I was the one who had to remind her of the final deadline just days before it came about. These are just a very small few examples of the many situations in which she says she'll do stuff and then never does. It's also upsetting because she's had off from work from the past two months and has literally spent every day just camped in front of the TV playing video games. She acts like doing super basic things like laundry or cleaning is a triumph that I should be eternally grateful for, and how dare I expect anything more (for the record, I also do laundry and clean.

"""I cannot believe I have to resort to bringing my grievances to reddit, but as a long time redditor and someone who keeps getting insults hurled at them I really need to know if I'm the crazy one.

My (30F) husband (30M) is pregnant with our first child. We recently found out that we're having a little baby boy. A few weeks ago we decided to write down all the boy names we like, make a priority list, and then let the names simmer for a couple of weeks before we make any judgement calls. Now, I know the names my husband likes. If I'm being completely honest, they are usually very Southern and attempting to be ""modern"" (think the name Kaysen or Braxton, both names were on the list). However, at the top of his list and one with a high priority was the name Scott. Now, no hate to the name Scott, just very out of left-field for him. He told me how much he loved it and how it meant a lot to him and when I questioned him on it he didn't really say much more. I actually loved the name Scott so we kept it #1 and it was also at the top of my ""simmer list"" as we had been calling it.

Well yesterday we ended the our simmer period and both decided on the name Scott Kainen. Both names were #1 on our lists and we were over the moon. As we were going to bed I asked how he thought of the name Scott and he admitted to me that now that I ""set it in stone"" that he felt more comfortable telling me. There was an older woman he apparently worked with, who I had never heard of before, that he really loved named Scott. He said she was 66 and gave him a lot of life advice and guidance but died last year due to being immunocompromised.

After he said this to me I became completely uncomfortable. I don't want our baby named after a dead coworker of his I've never met. I asked if he asked her family if it was ok and he said he's never met her family and doesn't think it's necessary. The whole thing is just so bizarre to me considering I've never heard of this woman before. He mentioned the passing of a coworker last year and I knew he was sad but he never said much more than that.

Long story short- I told him we're not naming our baby Scott because I don't feel comfortable with it. He immediately got mad at me and it turned into a big argument. I had his dad and brother call me today saying I liked the name before but that I was being a jerk over some old lady and my husband won't even talk to me now.

I like, even love, the name Scott. I don't like naming our baby my husband's dead coworker I don't know. AITA?

Edit: Just for clarification, I would not mind keeping the name Scott (and I have communicated this to my husband) if he would tell me about her so I know who we're naming our child after. He won't tell me anything past that she was a mentor to him - no other details. As well, I was mainly upset because I felt like I was tricked into the name because he withheld obvious intent with its meaning. I would have probably been a lot less confused or weirded out if he would have just explained that before. But since he will not talk to me about Scott and is essentially stonewalling me until I give in, I feel as if I may not be the AH here. I will take my judgements as they come, but there's more of my side of the story.

Edit 2: sorry for the edits I just want to clarify the permission from the family thing. He wants to actively make posts linking to her facebook about our child's growth and development. I feel like it was a little... weird to do without asking her family if they're comfortable with that especially since they've never met. That's why I thought he knew her family because he was telling me the hashtag he created for it and everything.""",0,Female,genderbent

"another post got me thinking about my own situation involving a suit, and i've been called the asshole and my husband is pissed at me - so just wanted to check in to see if I really am or is my thinking justified.

This happened a couple of weeks ago at a wedding my husband (37m) had attended. during the reception, while everyone was dancing and generally having a pretty good time he was sitting off to the side while I mingled with my friends (it was my friend's wedding so he didn't really know anyone there).

at one point I called out to him to come over - so he stood up from the chair he was chilling on and started walking over. He accidentally bumped into an older man and spilled his drink (wine) all over his suit - he immediately felt bad, the man started tearing up saying his night was ruined and offered to pay for the damages. he ended up leaving early since he was wearing like a... pastel pink(?) and the red wine did not compliment it, to say the least.

A couple of days later, the man contacted him and asked if he was still willing to pay for the damages. and he said of course, it was his bad - and the man then sent him a link to another suit that looked nothing like the one he ruined, and it costs $6k+ (???) and he said there was no way to fix the damages to the original suit so if he can buy this suit as a replacement.

sure, he could afford the suit, and he does feel bad that he ruined the original suit, but felt that the price of the new suit was suspicious, so he messaged back saying ""I'll need proof that the original suit costed similar to the amount this new suit costs. so send over the details and I'll get it sorted"" but somewhat expected, the man started making excuses saying he lost the original receipt, or that the designers website isn't listing the suit, blah blah blah. He told him to send the proof within 24 hours from the time of this last message. so he called him a child for not taking responsibility and that he should pay for the new suit since he has the means to pay (he does, but big question is how does he know this) - He told him no dice, ""it's simple, give me proof the original costed anywhere close to the price of the new suit and it'll be done - 24 hours or offer is off the table.""

anyways, I'm sure you can guess what happened - but no proof was sent so he dropped the matter and told him as such. turns out this man was the bride's brother (my friend), and now he's angry that he refused to pay for the new suit and now my husband is angry since his friends are now angry at him. although he agrees that the price of the new suit seems ridiculous and said that no way did the original suit costed that much since in his words ""like how, he's a welfare sponge"" (someone who games the welfare system) but he still thinks he should pay for the new suit so that I don't lose my friend.

The two of them have been working together to plan a family road trip, the highlight of which is to build bears at a big mall nearby. I don’t love the idea, because the house is too cluttered already, but it’s their birthday. 

The trouble is that my husband is insisting our 4yo should get to build a bear also. It isn’t his birthday. My husband points out that Build a Bear had party packages back before the world changed, and they included a bear for each child in attendance. He says it’s cruel to expect any child, especially at such a young age, to go into that store and assist other kids with building bears only to leave empty-handed. In his estimation we’re “asking for” a major tantrum from our youngest, the consequences of which would end up ruining everyone’s afternoon. 

I want our youngest to be a well-adjusted kid who understands birthdays are about the person whose birthday it is. Our older two didn’t get any toys when he turned 4, even though his day involved a fun attraction and a walk through the gift shop. That’s always been how we’ve done it. Birthday child gets toys, nobody else does. Husband thinks this time is different, but I don’t see why it should be.""",1,Female,genderbent
"""My(27F) husband(23M) frequently checks my phone because he's afraid I'd do something wrong.  The reason he thinks that is because both his exes were doing things behind his back. He goes through my search history, my apps, my mails, my messages with friends and family like I'm a toddler. He even goes as far as to message the male contracts I have on my phone and try to check if I'm flirting with them or something. He also reads my letters and goes through my things.

I have spoken to him about this and told him that I need my space and I feel violated by his intrusion into my personal space.  He says that if I'm not guilty of anything I shouldn't have any problem with being checked.

"""I feel like I probably need to give some background for my reaction to make sense…

When I found out I was pregnant my ex-girlfriend and her family weren’t thrilled. They thought I had done it on purpose and that I was trying to both trap and ruin my ex-girlfriend's life. My ex-girlfriend's parents tried very hard to get me to have an abortion, they even went so far as to trying to bribe me to do it. When that didn’t work, they made a lot of threats about taking my daughter away from me and how she would grow up never knowing who I was. In the end, I took the money and lied about having the abortion just so they would leave me alone. When my daughter was a year old my ex-girlfriend found out and her parents tried to make good on their threat. What followed was the most emotionally and financially draining experience of my life. My ex-girlfriend eventually seemed to realise it wasn't in our daughter's interest to do what her parents' planned and stopped trying to take our daughter away from me just when it looked like they were going to get what they wanted. Now I reluctantly co-parent with her and even though I try to be nice to her for our daughter's sake I’ve refused to have anything to do with her family. I accept my daughter will spend time with that side of her family, but I want no part of it.

So, I was shocked when they showed up on my doorstep and told me they had come to pick my daughter up because my ex-girlfriend was held up by a client meeting. I told them that she wouldn’t be going with them, and they can tell my ex-girlfriend to come and pick her up when she was done. They asked me if they could come inside and see her since they hadn’t seen her in so long and they were already here. I didn’t even respond; I just slammed the door shut in their face. They kept knocking and I ignored it. I took my daughter in the garden as the doorbell isn’t so loud outside and distracted her until they stopped.

My ex-girlfriend called me over 10 times while they were still knocking but I ignored it, she also sent me a text saying it was her time and she had given permission for them to collect her. My ex-girlfriend ended up coming to my house long after our daughter had gone to bed, and she was furious. We had a huge argument where she said her parents were our daughter’s family too and I had to let the past go. I told her I would never let it go and that I didn’t want her parents coming to my home ever again. My ex-girlfriend tried to say if I had forgiven her, I could forgive them too. I’ve tried to keep my feelings on the matter to myself because it won’t help us co-parent, but I was so angry in the moment that I told her I hadn’t forgiven her, and I wish she would leave and never come back. Now she’s acting weird around me and even our daughter mentioned her mom seemed sad.

"I am posting this for my father (m53) who does not have or use Reddit but enjoys having me read AITA situations. He now finds himself in one.

My dad works as a teacher for a small non-profit school making about $38k a year. He owns his own car outright and rents his home. He has a fair amount of debt (medical bills, collections, credit cards, back taxes, etc.). In addition to his bills, he was only paid part-time in the summer, and although he worked another part-time job, he did fall behind and has been playing catch up.

Enter my dad's girlfriend (F45), we'll call her Jane. They have known each other through AA for a few years and started dating earlier this year. She is never married and childless. She works in construction, not sure exactly how much she makes, but we do know it's $80-100k a year. She owns her own truck outright and has a home with a mortgage and has made a point to mention she has no debt. She does have a brother (50) who lives with her and pays partial utilities and no rent. She has cared for him for several years due to a disability. He can live independently and chooses not to as he doesn't like to rent from strangers.

Jane has stayed over at my dad's house at least 98% of the time since about May. She has seen him struggle with incoming and balancing bills and payment plans and is aware of the financial strain. My dad doesn't like asking for help and feels that since she has been used for money in the past by men and has her own household and bills, she doesn't want her to feel an obligation.

She has recently started talking about long term and marriage. My dad likes the current two-house situation, so if he needs time away, he can have it by sending her to her own home. But he has talked to me about being okay with moving into one home if they are married. However, he is concerned about the financial situation.

The question is, would he be in the wrong to expect Jane to offer to pay some sort of rent for staying with him the bulk of the time, or since she has yet to offer, would he be wrong to ask her to help with bills if she's planning on furthering their relationship?

My wife and I are taking opposite sides of this, I may be partial to my dad though.",0,Male,genderbent
"""So I(24M) have been an atheist for a big portion of my life. However, I met my now fiancée (Just turned 30F) about 2 years ago now who is very spiritual. Since then I have come to be an agnostic pagan but I have not told my parents this. They wouldn't disown me or anything, but they already have issues with my fiancée because she isn't like them and I don't think they would really understand.

We intend to be engaged for a little while due to the \*\*\*\* and the finances but we have been seriously looking at a more pagan wedding and I recently discovered the handfasting ceremony. Which I think is absolutely incredible and I really want to do it. The best part is there are many versions of it and since it is reconstructed we can fine tune it to make it work for us. I also was never Christian and have a huge array of issues with it, it would feel weird to get married with a Christian priest who might think I should burn in hell for existing.

This would all come as a huge surprise to my parents. But an even bigger surprise to any of my way more conservative relatives from other far away countries. I feel like it would come down to the ""Well we always wanted to see you get married like this..."" and some of my relatives are very old like my 90+ year old grandmother and some are religious etc. I just predict it being a huge mess.

Would I be TA if I still went through it and we started planning for that instead of a traditional wedding? Despite kind of knowing it will be protested against? Do I have to explain myself to my parents beforehand?

P.S. Any ""Return to Jesus"" comments will be reported immediately I have no tolerance for it.

EDIT: This got way more attention than I expected, but thank you all so much for the support and kind words! I will keep thinking on how I want to talk to relatives about it but at the very least the invitations will likely say that it will be a handfasting ceremony. Thank you all again, and best wishes!""",0,M,genderbent
"""I dated ""Jenna"" a couple of years ago and, just to sum it up quickly, the relationship took a huge toll on me. I lost most of my friends after we broke up because they ""sided"" with her (even though she broke up with me). My self-esteem was gone. I questioned myself about whether I had been the problem. Even though we broke up a long time ago it's had lasting effects on me and has made it hard to form healthy new relationships. I recently started therapy and have been doing research, and I'm starting to suspect that it wasn't just a ""bad fit,"" but that Jenna was emotionally abusive.

Jenna recently dated a new man for a few months and I'll admit I snooped on his social media and found out that he has a YouTube channel. He doesn't talk much about his personal life there but on a recent video, he mentioned an incident with his recent ex (Jenna) that sounded so similar to things I experienced with her. I don't want to upset him or cause drama or come across as the crazy ex, but I have been considering reaching out to him and seeing if he'd be open to talking with me. I'd like to know what his perception of Jenna was and whether he considered her to be emotionally abusive because a big part of me still feels like I'm overreacting. I think I might be the asshole if I do this because I'm not actually sure that she was abusive, and if she wasn't, I'm potentially spreading rumors about her that could damage her life.""",1,Male,genderbent
"""I (26M) am married to my wife (27F) for about 2 years now. Our main problem in our marriage is my wife's friend (24M) whom I really don't care for. 

They used to be in the same unit together when she was in the marines. I have met him a few times but it was never a big deal because he was always just my wife's coworker. A year ago, he was in a bad relationship so my wife and I watched his dog so he could move out of the home he shared with his then girlfriend. 

Their relationship blossomed from there. Now they are in constant communication with each other, multiple times a day. Most of the time, it's multiple lines of communication at one time (EX: they will send memes to each other on Instagram, while also snapchatting, while also texting). Anytime he needs something, he calls my wife, no matter what time of day it is or what she's doing. He's called her for ""nutrition advice"" even though he has a trainer he pays $200 a month for this reason. He's sent her snapchats of himself crying saying how he just really needs someone to talk to so my wife has left the house, at midnight, to be there for him. It's even gotten to the point where she has had to tell him to stop calling her on the weekends so she could spend uninterrupted time with me.

Everytime I bring up an issue I have with the boundaries of the friendship, we argue. She says it's because I always come off like I'm accusing her of doing something wrong. I've tried several different ways to approach the situation but nothing comes out right. 

I don't know what's the best way to handle this situation anymore. I feel like the jealous husband that doesn't want her to have male friends which isn't the case. I've told her multiple times I don't have a problem with him or the friendship, however our marriage needs to be respected at the same time. I understand he won't understand that because he's younger and not married. She wants to go see him next month but of course, I have no desire too.

"For context, my girlfriend (24F) and I (20M) have been dating a couple of very short, very sweet months. Until now.

My birthday is the day before halloween. She had informed me we were invited to a party and my initial reaction was that of disappointment, as I'd honestly thought she'd have already made plans for us that night.

We talked for a bit and came to a conclusion that we were both feeling a bit in disagreement and then we'd talk it over in person.

An hour later she declares she's going to the party and she's going to see her friends whether I like it or not. I'm upset. I'm hurt more than anything by her abrupt behaviour, and lack of consideration for me.

We discuss and for some reason this time she's not understanding. She isn't apologetic despite how hurt I explain I am over her actions, and then from 8pm onward refuses to text me.

At 11 she says ""she's too stressed from work to deal with this, so night.""

We were awesome up until now, I was head over heels but she's set to meet my mom tomorrow over thanksgiving (met my dad last weekend) and I feel very hurt and alone right now, kind of like I was tossed aside and not even worth a phone call.

"Hi everyone! Asking here if I’m (24M) the asshole.

My fiancée (27F) and I have four dogs, and a bird together. Our most recent addition is an 11 week old puppy. I handle all our pets general health care meaning vet visits, giving any medication, and making sure they’re on their correct supplements. 

I recently took our two older dogs (6F and 3F) to get boosters on vaccines, as well as their rabies, and heartworm testing done. While doing this, I thought it would be a smart idea to make a binder including all the individual pets past visits, as well as a brief summary for each pet on past illnesses/current medications/current feeding, and their overall temperament, to prepare anyone caring for our animals to be aware of everything. I also included pictures of each animal, and our own contact information.

When I showed my fiancée she told me this was “extra” and then implied she wouldn’t be taking/using the binder, and that it was almost demeaning to the vet staff. I thought this might make their jobs easier, but is it an asshole move to make a “guide” to my pets general information?""",0,Male,genderbent

So when COVID ends, my boyfriend’s parents will be visiting him and I will meet them for the first time. He told me I have to change the way I look (to his standard) and that we would have to buy outfits to look “presentable” to his family and tell them that he has the role of manager at his job.

I told him I will not be doing that. I’m pretty comfy in my own skin and won’t be lying and spending money on clothes I won’t wear after they’re gone just to impress them. If they don’t think I’m a good partner for him because I treat him well and try my damn hardest to make him feel loved, then they are vain and vapid and only care about money.

She works in a bar, usually clocking out around 11ish. Bars iny area close at midnight/1am, but she doesn't come home until 5, 6, sometimes 7am.

"For background I (f23) have been with my bf (m22) for about 3 and a half years now. We both live with our parents in a rural town without bussing and both our jobs are in the city about half an hour away. We've been looking for an apartment for the past little while but vacancy rates are extremely low in our area so it's been difficult. I drive my own car but my bf doesn't have a car or a license so he gets drives from his mom (f40something) whom I will call Alice.

I won't sugarcoat things, Alice is terrible when it comes to finances and can be really stupid in general at somepoints. She even had to declare bankruptcy. She struggles to pay any of her bills and as a result, my bf and his older brother (m23) are constantly bailing her out. As of now, they don't have internet, they go without hot water for weeks at a time and are now possibly going to lose their house.

As of now, my bf's brother doesn't have any savings to speak of because he gives the majority of his paycheck to Alice and the only reason my bf has any savings is because I told him he needs to put his foot down and start saving if we want to get a place. When you work fulltime and still live with your parents, its natural to give a few hundred bucks here and there to help but trust me when I tell you they were both going way beyond what is reasonable. I've voiced frustration over the situation before but of course, bf always defends his mom and then I drop it.

The situation reached a boiling point when Alice was pulled over the other day for an expired registration sticker. It turned out she was driving without proof of insurance (fyi she has insurance, just didn't have proof with her) and her plate wasn't even registered with her car. Cops impounded it and now she's facing over 2 grand in fines she doesn't have. She doesn't have a credit card and now of course, bf and his brother have to bail her out again and I very much doubt she'll be able to pay them back. Bf was texting me about it obviously stressed because they can't get to work because of the car and I said ""I'm really angry at your mom right now. I can't believe she was that stupid, it's exhausting see you constantly having to bail her out."" At which point, he stopped responding and haven't responded all day.

"""My BF (39M) and I (34F) have been together for a little over 2 years now. We moved towns into a house my father owns, that would otherwise be sitting vacant. We pay the mortgage and utilities as our ""rent"" as the end goal is for us to eventually outright own the home.

When my BF and I got together, he had told me that it had been almost a year since he had been able to see his family (a combination of distance and a raging narcissistic ex keeping him from being able to do so often.) This didn't sit well with me, so I took him on the hour-ish-long trip just to not only see his family, but celebrate his SIL's birthday.

When our own living situation, near the start of our relationship, turned sour, they took us in and we lived in the spare apartment-style basement in their home while the spare house was being readied for us to move in.

Just before COVID hit, he lost his job. Since my state was on complete lockdown, his only options were to try and find a work-from-home position. Unfortunately, this process took several months to find one; and we would barter favors instead of payments for the rent and utilities. It was a nice, tidy arrangement that worked well for all of us involved until he found another job. And, he did eventually find another job that not only paid well, but he absolutely loved.

After several months of medical complications, he went through the V.A. to check on V.A. disability, and found out that he qualified. Not only was he able to bring in money again, it was comparable to the job that he had. Life looked good again!

While he doesn't mind helping his father (whom is not only getting up in years, but has severe health issues of his own,) his brother-in-law and SIL have a hard time being responsible for themselves.

Instead of asking my BF, now, if he's willing to do things, they end up voluntelling him that he's helping. Recently, he's been voluntold to help in two baby showers for people he barely even knows. I've almost been volunteered to help, but those had been kaiboshed due to my own appointments. This, of course, has forced the brother-in-law and SIL to ""make arrangements"" to rearrange themselves. When they say this, it makes it sound like we're the ones inconveniencing them!

"Background: my (37m) son (7m) would go to his mom’s (37f) just about every other weekend until she physically attacked his sister at her other daughter’s graduation party. She was then kicked out of her folks’ home. That was back in June and I had to go pick up my son since his mom was getting kicked out.

She doesn’t pay child support or contribute in any way in raising our son. She hasn’t called to talk to our son or even ask how he’s doing (even before all that) and especially since. About a month ago, last minute, she text me if we had eaten lunch yet. I replied right away that we were heading to a birthday party, which we were. An hour and a half later she text back “k.” and then nothing.
A couple Fridays ago, she text me at almost 6pm if we had eaten dinner yet. I replied that we had plans already, which we did. She wanted to have a meal and see our son- which I understand.

I told her that our son deserves consistency and the best version of us and that she needs to focus on getting stable and then we can go from there.

I know she talks bad about me, like I try and keep our son from her. I don’t. Our son doesn’t need to see that she’s been living in her car since June.

Well, earlier this week she was arrested on felony charges. She called earlier while I was at work wanting to talk to our son. Since I was working, our son wasn’t with me. She called again later this evening. It sounded so phony. Like she only calls once she’s in jail to act like she actually cares, which she doesn’t. She just likes to feed her ego.

I will add, she was very abusive to me physically, verbally and mentally when we were together and I got out once and for all when I had the chance.

"I have 4 kids (9, 7, 3 & 4m). As you can imagine life is pretty busy but I chose to have that many kids and I love it.

We have recently been in a Covid lockdown and had no school or daycare. It is currently school holidays. My wife does do her part for the kids where she can and she is a great mom but she is still working and the majority of the child care and housework falls onto me. This is how I like it but as anyone with multiple children knows, it’s also important to have an occasional break as well.

So to give us a break, my parents have taken my 3 older kids for a couple of days so I can spend some time with my baby, catch up on housework and hopefully get some time to relax.

So that brings us to the issue…today my FIL came over and brought my 10y nephew with him. Neither wife nor I knew my nephew was coming. I am usually happy for him to be here. He’s an only child and is going through some tough stuff at the moment so we have had him over more recently to give him a change of scenery and a chance to play with his cousins.

My problem with him being brought here today is that 1. FIL was coming around for me to fix his car and I asked wife to ask her dad to not to bring MIL or nephew with him because I had things I needed to do today and didn’t have time to entertain them again as they were also over yesterday, and 2. My kids weren’t here for my nephew to play with so he ended up just wanting to talk with me (and girl that kid can talk loud!) which also woke my baby up. And 3. Wife knows that I don’t like being surprised with guests (my introvert side needs to prepare for this!) but her parents do this all the time.

Mentioning this quietly to wife had no effect so I decided to message my MIL because I didn’t want to say anything to FIL or talk on the phone in front of my nephew. I didn’t want to make a big deal about it so specifically said they didn’t need to take him home and he could stay here as I don’t want to make my nephew feel unwelcome, but I asked that they let us know in advance next time so we could plan to have him here or could let them know it wasn’t a good time for him to come over.

But my MIL called my FIL and they decided to take him home. I had a chance to quickly talk with my FIL and she seemed fine about it all. I’m usually a fairly non confrontational person and will often just go along with things but I felt it was important enough to me that I stood up for what I wanted.

After they left my wife absolutely went off at me saying I was selfish and lazy and a horrible person for making her parents feel like they needed to take my nephew away.

"Hi all, I am new to reddit and just discovered AITA. This is something that has been bothering me since I discovered it so I figured I would post here to see if this is an issue that I should pursue with my husband.

My husband, Mark (not his name), and I recently had our first anniversary, while searching my email for the confirmation I found receipts for years worth of flowers to some woman. Specifically Mother’s Day flowers and they were each a couple hundred dollars. I asked my husband about it and he said “That’s Alice's mom, I send her flowers and a card every year on Mother’s Day.”
It is important for me to mention that Alice passed away before my husband and I met. It’s also important to mention that Alice had a son so it’s not like he has no one to wish him happy Mother’s Day. I mentioned this to my husband who said that Jack is barely a teenager who has his own dad to deal with on mother’s day and that Jack’s dad barely lets Alice's mom see Jack. He said that Alice's mom has lost both her children and she wants to be sure that Jack's mom doesn’t feel forgotten on mother’s day. Which I do agree with but I don’t see how that is our responsibility.

I dropped it at that point because I felt like if I didn’t there’d be a fight, but here are my points.

He doesn’t spend that kind of money on my mom or his own for mother’s day. And we aren’t exactly wealthy. He normally gives my mom a card for mother’s day which only costs a couple of bucks. Mark could send his mom a nice text or something to make her feel remembered.

Alice's mom DOES have someone, she has Jack and a wife so it’s not like she’s some lonely old lady.

My husband barely knows this woman. She lives on the other side of the country and the only time they met in person was for Alice's funeral. It feels weird that he’s doing this for someone he barely knows. I think it may be more about him still having feelings for her.

Edit: Wow. Okay I get that I am probably TA, I do want to talk to him about it though because I do feel like he was hiding it from me (or at least not being super open about it.)

A few responses to people’s questions/assumptions:
Our finances are combined. These flowers DO exceed our agreed upon personal purchase limit.
We are very tight with money, as in needing to prioritize bills to pay and putting a limit on groceries tight.
Mark was never married to Alice so he isn’t a widower, but they were sort of living together when she passed so they were in a committed relationship.
As for my mom, she and Mark get along fine, covid definitely put a dampener on them getting to know each other (we did the courthouse thing during the pandemic and haven’t had our reception yet, finances are still an issue as well as this whole delta variant).",1,Female,genderbent
"Ok so me and my girlfriend went out on a double date to an arcade, me and the gf are pretty poor currently and her friend was down to pay for the arcade (she actually has a ton of points built up that she already bought for games and such that we all used) and we bought our own dinner and it was really appreciated and fun. Well she used some of her points to get her bf a plushie and got me one too and offered to get my gf one but gf didn’t want anything. All good but there was a squishmallow I was really eying so I got that. Well we get home and she tells me she doesn’t want me to keep it and is really rude about it. She said the smile I got when I got it was too big or something and idk I guess she was just jealous. I think we could’ve talked something out but she started calling me a spoiled brat when I said I wanted to keep it and said that she helps me with my medical shit (I’m a diabetic and she gets me stuff for my low bloodsugars) so I should do this for her and that made me feel really bad and like a burden so I went home and left the plushy there. I just feel like this never should’ve been such a big deal in the first place but I don’t really get jealous so maybe I’m missing something. So AITA?",0,Male,genderbent
"""My (27f) fiancée (24m) and I recently moved in together. We have been together around 3 years and are recently engaged. 

We truly are best friends. We spend a lot of our time together but the perfect amount of time alone/doing our own thing. 

Moving in has been an adjustment for us. We struggle sometimes when it comes to decisions because we want different things. I.e, he wants a cat, I don’t want any animals at all. He has been trying to talk me into it but I don’t want one. Imo, the person who doesn’t want the animal is the person who should have the say given what a huge adjustment it makes to living situation. 

We also discussed our Christmas tree we plan to get and he gushed over getting a white one to match the way he has the apartment decorated (he has great taste and has it decorated very beautifully). I immediately told him that we would be getting a green tree because that’s the norm and that’s what I grew up with. He suggested we draw out of a hat to make this decision fair so one person isn’t having more of a say than the other. I told him we would see. 



Our newest disagreement is that he wants to smoke weed tonight when his sister comes over.

We smoke, but we use oil pens so there isn’t a smell. We specifically quit buying pot for our move in since we were renting an apartment now. Pot doesn’t bother me and I did it at my previous place but now that we’ve moved we don’t smoke it like that. 

Once we moved in, we quickly realized our neighbors smoke pot as well as a friend that lives nearby in the same complex. We can smell it every day, but we still just stick to our oil pens. 

The other night we went to dinner with his mom and sister and got fairly drunk. His sister said she got a new bong she’d like to bring over soon and try just once and I said sure without really thinking. 

Well, his sister is coming over tonight and my fiancée texted me saying she was bringing the bong over for us to try. 

I told him I didn’t want it in the apartment because of the smell and he reminded me of the yes I gave the other night and said it won’t hurt being one time. I still am not comfortable with this because I don’t want it to smell, so he said he’d go somewhere in a car and smoke like a “child” even though he’s 24. He went on to say he has no say in anything and normal adults can do what they please in a place they pay to live in. 

He sent me a long text message saying that if I didn’t want it in the house it’s fine, but me agreeing and then saying no last minute messed up their plans for tonight. His issue is “the principal of me changing my mind and thinking I can call every single shot as I please”. I think he’s being unreasonable and feel like I am well within my rights to not want that in my apartment, even if I agreed before. 

AITA here? He took my drunk yes and is now annoyed he has to go elsewhere to smoke.""",1,Female,genderbent
"To start off by saying that my girlfriend and I have a very loving and trusting relationship, we're both 29 and have been dating for a year, we've known each other for multiple years tho but got together last year.

My girlfriend has a man best friend who she's really close to. The first months that man and I got along really well although sometimes I caught him saying some shady stuff but I chose to brush it off as my own insecurity and said to myself it's not that deep. One day he casually mentioned he is very close to my girlfriend's brother and I said that's great, her brother is a really sweet guy. He then replied to me by saying ""You know her brother calls me brother-in-law right? It's a thing we say because he and I were convinced I'd date (girlfriend) at some point and get married."". It was totally unprovoked and I was taken aback. My girlfriend wasn't present at that moment it was just him and I grabbing lunch. I was very upset by what he said and I couldn't keep it from my gf, so I asked her what her friend meant by that. She claimed he wasn't serious and it's just a joke but she can see why I'm upset and would tell him to not make that joke again.

Last week I had an accident and broke my leg and one of my arms. I was hospitalised and my girlfriend came to see me as soon as I notified her. I asked her if she wanted to stay the night in the hospital with me or if I should tell my dad to stay. She said she'd stay with me and my dad could go home. All that happened at around 10pm. At around 12pm she got a call from her bff and he told her he wants to go have some drinks because he's bored. She told him she couldn't come because she's in the hospital with me for the night. When they hung up she was telling me he got upset and told her he'd go with him. At that time I got very mad and told her that I find it ridiculous how I sent my dad (which is a 1.5-hour drive) home so she could stay with me instead and now she wants to go for drinks because her friend got upset. She apologized and said she knows its wrong but also can't upset her friend because she can't bear to see him upset. I said what about me, your hospitalized bf? She told me I'm being selfish saying that. I then got even more mad and told her how I think her bff is using her for emotional comfort every time he's single and forgets about her existence when he's having flings with girls. Told her how he has always provoked me by saying shady stuff about me being temporary and him being the actual future partner of hers. She basically implied I'm TA for speaking like that for her bff and for implying he's a manipulator who uses her.

I understand I might be TA for phrasing it like that in the heat of the moment and for keeping what had happened in the past from her, but AITA for saying that???",0,Male,genderbent
"Sorry my English.   


Early this year, Lisa, a friend of my wife, asked her if she wanted to be the godmother of her kid, (I think the kid is almost 2) and my wife said to me she didn't want to, so I  was like, say no if you don't want to.   


She has 2 ahijados already, and in catholicism that's a very big deal, I was raised catholic but don't believe in church and that stuff, so finally she was like, I can't support another ahijado because she likes to give gifts and take trips with them, so SHE TOLD ME I'm going to say no.    


I thought that she said no and I was like good for you, but almost a week ago she said that she needed to buy the outfit for the kid and said that her dad convinced her, because if she say no to that, she will be look down by God 😒. So I help her and  I found a good deal and pay for it (she pays me back).   


Today she said Lisa wanted us in church this Sunday at 6am and I said that was too early for a baptism and she said it's for the talks about being godmother and godfather, My wife said YES for me too. I don't want to go and she is mad that how is going to tell No to her friend.   


I  don't know the kid, I  don't like Lisa or her husband, I visit them with my wife because she insists, but no one asked me if I wanted to be a godfather, and I can't do it because a godfather has to be close to the kid, and I don't tolerate churches, and my wife knows that, I'm super mad at her

"""So my (29m) girlfriend (33f) has an old truck. She bought it for $600 a few years ago. It's rusted, dirty, and the breaks went out last week. So last month-ish it was struck my one of those individual apple sauce containers. She was incensed to say the least. So she put up a sound/motion camera on our banister going down the steps facing her truck. The problem is, when it goes off, she checks it, and if it's one of the neighborhood kids she watches, apparently waiting for one of them to say "" Remember when we threw applesauce at that girl's truck"", so that she can, and I quote, ""Scare them straight"". Originally, she said she'd find out which bus stop they got off at to do so. Or maybe she'd just come barreling out of the house, idk. I told her she was delusional and if she carried out her plan she'll be labeled the neighborhood creep and we'll be lucky if they don't break out the torches and pitchforks (exaggerating a bit, I know) and she said that if she followed through the parents would even agree with her.

"I am in grade 11 college chem doing stoichiometry. I have been struggling and behind on my work for the last little while and tonight it finally clicked and I was able to answer a question on my own which made me super excited. While I was raving about how happy I am to finally solve such a hard question, she came over and started hitting my vape and just staring at the question. (Keep in mind I’ve showed her the work from this course before because she is good with math and she had no clue and got the wrong answer!) She told me that the question was easy and she remembers doing it in grade 10, although she had no clue what to do in the much easier parts of the course so I don’t know why she would know what to do for this part. She said it was super easy even though my chemistry teacher said herself that stoichiometry is hard and takes a lot of practice. So I asked my girlfriend “you have to find the molecular what in order to answer the question” and she said she forgot. I then asked her how you find molecular mass since it’s super simple and her being a genius she should know right, well she didn’t. So I told her next time she tells me the work I’ve been trying to figure out for days is easy, she better know how to do it.

"""Hey Reddit! What’s going on? I’m in a little bit of a jam. 

Okay so a few nights ago me 22F and my partner 19M went to my school friends house for a party. We have been dating about 2 weeks and we have known each other for about 6 months. 

His father has been a little suspect of me as I am 3 years older, which I totally understand because it played on my mind too before I asked him out. But he is just amazing in all ways and I can’t imagine myself with someone else. 

Anyway, the other night I took him too my mates place for a party as I wanted to introduce him to all my school friends. I checked with my old man and he said yes as long as I am back by 10pm. Another consideration is that he doesn’t drive. I say “yep no problem” and he agreed to. 

On the way to the party he tells me to just ignore my dad and have a few drinks and take him back in the morning. I protested and said no I want to earn his old mans trust and so him respect. This hurt as I wanted nothing more than to spend the night together but I felt it was right.

So 9:30 rolls around and I say to him “let’s go” I don’t wanna be late. I then turn to a mate and say “leave that whiskey for me I got some catching up to do when I get back.” He protests saying he is having a good time and that he doesn’t want to go. We talk, keep it civil and eventually he agrees and we leave.

In the car I explained to him my stance and reinforce how much I don’t wanna do this. He is just quiet, when I get to his place I walk him to the door. My father answers said “thank you and what you’ve done means a lot,” I say “too easy” and accept his handshake. 

My partner is still a little annoyed hinting that he thinks this isn’t gonna work. 

I don’t want this to be over, he is amazing in every way, and I understand that what I did was sexist as I was putting the wants of the father over him, but I do not want him to stop me from seeing him as he didn’t trust me. 

So reddit AITA?

Just quick edit. Wow this got more attention then expected. Cheers for all your input guys!

Also wanna add: I made it clear to him when we were discussing this that this was only a one maybe two time thing, as I want his dad to a) trust me, b) not worry about his son when we are out and c) he didn’t get shouted out when we got home so that we can spend more nights out together. This will not be occurring in the future. 

And I did not get any joy what so ever from doing this. It is the polar opposite of what I personally wanted to do! I just did what I felt was right so that we can continue seeing each other

Edit #2:
All’s good in the world! Just got off the phone from him and his old man. 

His old man again thanked me, then told me that he will no longer be imposing any restrictions to us going out (Yay) and that apologised for putting me in a hard situation. He was just very wary of the age gap. He than left the room, or at least I hope he did haha. 

The better half than hoped on and said that he understood my reasoning and that his dad told him after I dropped him off that if he didn’t bring me back he would forced him to break up with me. After reflection from the posts here I apologised for heading back to the party, to which he responded “why shouldn’t you enjoy yourself cause my dads a downer.” We then had a laugh and made plans for tonight! No curfew in sight! 

Edit #3: Thanks for all your guys input, however I have seen a few people placing my bf into an asshole category, which I think is a little unfair. I’m more than happy to accept I was somewhat of an ass and so was the father. However my bf is an awesome kind person who just wanted to spend time with me. In no way would he want to cause an argument with his old man over this cause he doesn’t like conflict. Please be understanding that he is from a strict household which makes it incredibly tough to stand up for himself. He is no asshole!""",0,Female,genderbent
"Throwaway account because my husband browses Reddit and knows my main

My birthday was last week. I know as you get older, people say birthdays become less and less important, but I grew up working class and birthdays could never really be celebrated, so I like to make up for it as an adult. I’ve kept a lot of the same interests that I had as a kid, so it’s pretty evident what I like (ie, I have a toooon of D&D figures and Pokémon card posters)

Anyway, I’ve been with my husband for 10 years now, 4 dating and 6 married. He has forgotten my birthday in the past, and it was pretty common to receive birthday gifts from him well into November. After the first couple of times I started leaving more reminders around the house when it was a couple weeks out, nothing massive but like writing “OP’s birthday” on the right date on the calendar. This time around I did the same thing, and the day came to pass and nothing happened. No “happy birthday”, no plans to go out or celebrate. 

I went and talked to my husband, and just gently reminded him that, “hey, it’s my birthday, maybe we could do something?”, and he immediately yelled at me to stop harassing him about my birthday, and called me an asshole for making him feel like shit for not getting me anything, and that, “you only care about the presents anyway.” I didn’t respond, just turned around and secluded myself in the office. I called my dad for advice and he said I shouldn’t have confronted my husband about, and that he probably felt suffocated from constant reminders of “something as little as a birthday.” AITA?",0,Female,genderbent
"My Partner, 'Samantha' (28F) and I (28M) have been together 5 years. We live together.

I work in a school so although I get a lot of holiday days, I am only off when the school is off.

One of Samantha's uni mates is getting married in May. She's due to have her hen party in April. Samantha doesn't see her friends or go away that often, especially recently due to the plague.

For starters this hen party - is SEVEN WHOLE DAYS. A Sunday to the following Saturday. 
So she has to use holiday off work. (The wedding itself is also a weekday so that's another days holiday to spend). Hens are ordinarily 3-4 days over a weekend.
It's over Easter Sunday and Monday as well so it's only four holiday days (out of her 25!) instead of 5, but ITS EASTER???

I'm upset she's having to use so much of her holiday when in all my previous jobs I have never had any. And because of the plague we haven't been able to do anything together but we were looking forward to 2022 because things should be better then.

The week Samantha goes on this hen party is a week I'll have off. We had a gig booked that week... and we were going to make a little city break of it (as it's not in our town). So that's another issue. I'm sure I can cancel it or bring someone else to the gig and go without a little holiday but that's just another bleh thing. The only money spent already was on the gig tickets and they were under £30 each.

The hen party is in Inverness and we live in the South of England. So Samantha is flying. We live about a 30-60 minute drive from the airport (traffic depending, but it's usually awful). Samantha does not drive. Because it's Easter Sunday there will likely not be any public transport. I'm already angry at this whole situation but now Samantha wants me to drive her to the airport on top of this. I have said no. I already obviously do all the driving for US (she has never asked me to drive for HER in a similar situation) but doing all the driving for shopping, holidays, day trips, etc is starting to get old after 5 years. Especially if we go to a nice restaurant so I end up not being able to have a nice wine.

I can't and won't stop her going but do I have any right to be upset and not drive her?

Some of my friends think I'm being selfish, but some others think the Bride is being selfish by asking a lot. Samantha thinks I'm being selfish too. I do feel like a bastard, but I am really upset about being left for a week, wasting holiday, and cancelling our existing plans. Because it's Easter a lot of my friends will be busy with family so I can't make plans with them.

Samantha rarely spends time away so I know I shouldn't be pissed, but I am. I have even said to her before that I worry she doesn't see her friends much.",1,Male,genderbent
"Throwaway: Me (25M) and my GF ""Darron"" (26F) have been together for 2 years. I also have a twin sister ""Jerry"" (25F) and we've always been quite close over the years. Darron has a pink teddy bear that she keeps in the living room, she got the bear from a boy when she was in the 1st grade. Darron was horrifically bullied all throughout school, and it's had a long lasting impact on her.

The day she got the bear, the whole class was doing some type of trading and sharing exercise. Well, everyone in the class traded/shared bears with each other...except for her. Even her Teacher ignored her and basically told her to ""suck it up!"" Darron ended up crying alone during recess while the other kids played with their bears. Later that day, one of Darron's classmates came up to her and gave her one of his teddy bears.

Even though this happened a long time ago when she was little, she still remembers that day so clearly/fondly. Talking about it still brings her to tears sometimes, and I cried my eyes out when she first told me that story. Her bear is very special to her, and she's kept it in near mint condition all these years. Yesterday, Jerry came over to our apartment to hang out and play video games.

Jerry has never seen Darron's teddy bear, Darron always keeps it hidden in the closet whenever we have guests. Darron decided to keep her bear in the living room because she said she was tired of keeping it a secret all the time. After about an hour of playing video games, Jerry took notice of the teddy bear. She said, ""Hey bro, when did you get this?""

Before I could respond, Darron said, ""Oh, that's mine."" Jerry looked confused and asked, ""Why do you have a pink teddy bear?"" Darron explained it by telling her the story about how she got it. Jerry then started laughing and said, ""Are you kidding? What girl keeps a toy that a boy gave her in the 1st grade?"" I could see that Darron was shaking and trying to hold back tears.

Jerry noticed this and said, ""Oh my god, are you actually crying? Who cries over a teddy bear?"" Jerry wouldn't stop laughing, so Darron just went into our bedroom. I snapped! I yelled, ""What the fuck is your problem?!"" Jerry said, ""Geez, I was just teasing."" I told her that she was just like all the bullies that made Darron's life a living hell! Jerry just kept saying that she was busting her balls and that I need to stay out of it.

I told her to get the hell out and never come back again! She got pissed and said, ""You can't be serious. I drove over 3 fucking hours to get here!"" I told her I don't give a shit and to get out before I call the Cops on her! She ended up going home and blabbing about me to our family and friends.

It was all already planned and things that could be bought beforehand were. Not really any changing of those plans. They were stuff we liked doing because well we thought it was only us 2 going. When I told my girlfriend I was going to be out for the day with her, she looked kind of annoyed. I asked her why and she said I never try or ask to bring her to do anything like that. Also that I spend too much time with friend and she didn't like that. So I did what I could think of and asked her if she wanted to go with us. She said sure but still didn't look happy and I went to go ask friend if it was ok. When I asked friend, she sounded irritated also. I was confused because I thought they got along pretty well but I was wrong, I guess.

The day we had the stuff planned we left and it seemed to be going well because girlfriend also liked a few things we were doing. Later though it was more stuff me and friend only like and girlfriend does not. When we would go, she would say like she will just stay outside or go do something else while we do.

"Sometimes when my (29 M) partner (28 F) is out at a bar or concert alone she starts chatting with the people around her. NOT flirting, just normal conversation like “how many times have you seen this band? What other shows are you going to?” Etc. Occasionally the girl she's talking to will ask her for her number when she’s trying to leave. 
Last night this happened and the girl was like, “hey we should meet up tomorrow for the next show! Let me get your number.” and my partner said sure and typed it in her phone, told her to have a good night, and left. She is 0% interested in this girl and has no intention of replying to a text if she were to send one. 
The reason she does this is because on several occasions if she has tried to politely turn down a girl by saying she’s not interested or she has a girlfriend for some reason they start acting aggressive, like she has done something wrong, and start cussing her out calling her a stupid bitch or similar. Other times they won’t take no for an answer and they will follow her to her car asking her over and over. It makes her really nervous when girls do this and when she’s alone somewhere (which she often is because she’s in a new city and I work graveyard shifts) and she knows she doesn’t have anyone that she could call to come rescue her if things go badly she just gives them her number to appease them so she can go on her way in peace. 
Why doesn’t she give a fake number? Because half the time they will call or text it while she’s standing next to them to check if it’s correct. 
She mentioned to me this morning that she did this and I was upset. She thought because we are in a loving and secure relationship that it would be no big deal and I would be more sympathetic that she has to deal with that sometimes. She explained her reasons but I’m not okay with it and I said she should make an AITA post to prove me right.

Edit to add: if they do call/text her she blocks their number immediately upon leaving and doesn’t reply.

"""I recently got out of a toxic relationship (26M) in which I raised a puppy with my ex (28F) for nearly 3 years. Our breakup was not unexpected and I had been mentally preparing myself for months to finally cut her out of my life. I do think I dissociated myself from any emotional attachments I had for the dog.

My ex would treat the dog as solely hers around other people, but would privately tell me that the dog was ""ours."" I would say that my ex had on several occasions used the dog to manipulate me into feeling guilt for wanting to leave the relationship. I guess at a certain point we both tried to force this ""bond"" between me and the dog because neither of us were ready to truly ""let go"" of the relationship.

I absolutely adored the dog and it truly was a gift to watch something so sweet grow up. At the time I was a struggling student with practically no income, so my ex legitimately was the dog's sole provider and caretaker. I had absolutely no problem with that, but found myself confused/frustrated when my ex would switch from her being the dog's sole owner to me being the dog's ""co-owner"" depending on her mood.

When I confided in close friends about this, I received silent judgment from them for not caring about the dog I helped raise for almost 3 years. AITA for no longer caring or missing the dog?

EDIT: I want to add that prior to leaving the relationship I knew that the dog was in good hands. My ex was not the most reliable or responsible person, but she did make an effort for the dog. Her parents also frequently let the dog stay in their home (with their other dogs who all get along) and took great care of them.

"I'm a single mom with 2 kids who has a financially dependent ex-husband. He rarely worked, even before the kids were born. Even though we initially agreed to both contribute financially since we were married and he lived with me. I ended up having to work extra hours to pay all the bills and mortgage on our house. Once the kids were born it got even worse. He wouldn't contribute a dime towards child care. I had to cover everything. As well as groceries we used for the kids. He worked a part-time retail job while the kids were in daycare and he spent all the money on things he wanted while I was left footing the bills for our kids.

I had to eventually work overtime to the point where I could barely spend time with our kids. I couldn't afford us going out on dates anymore. He's never contributing towards a single date during the relationship nor marriage. I tried having a talk with him about this but he still refused to contribute financially towards the kids, bills, date nights, and he was comfortable with me continuing paying for everything at the expense of me not having time with our kids.

This led to the divorce in which he tried to take everything from me including the house which is in our name but I pay for. And the car which I also paid for including the insurance and gas. He got the car but not the house thankfully. He's apparently now remarried to a woman who also has a good job like me and from what I found out, he quit his job but still sends the kids to daycare/school which I still pay for. I also pay for extracurricular activities, school supplies, medical co-payments after insurance, and so on.

A year ago I met a handsome, smart and independent man who's been a great partner. We don't live together yet but he occasionally helps with groceries when he visits and he's contributed to a decent portion of our dates. He recently admitted to me though that he's envious that my ex-husband doesn't pay anything to me and never did even when I was married. I feel bad. There's a couple more upcoming dates we were planning that will have to suddenly be put on the back burner because I have to cover the full expense regarding the kids of something my ex (their dad) was supposed to cover with me. We have 50/50 custody.

My boyfriend is an angel, and has covered many dates, including some groceries even though he doesn't live with me. I too have covered many dates between us as well. I feel bad for asking but I'm currently in a very rough financial spot because my ex will never financially contribute towards our kids. AITA for asking my boyfriend to pick up the next few date checks, if not postpone? If we postpone, it may be months before I can take him out on another date unless he chooses to take me out again. Also asking him for a few groceries? Not much, just a bit? My ex quit his job and spends his money. I can't force him to financially contribute to our kids. Also, in the divorce agreement, his lawyer put in a fine print clause that says the custody arrangement can't be changed.",1,Female,genderbent
"""I am Jane, my partner is Jon. We're both in our mid 20s with just a HS education. We both work full time and make similar amounts of money, about 60k annually. Neither of us is the breadwinner in any shape, we both contribute quite equally to our standing. We have a toddler and live in a 2bd apartment. Nothing is detrimental, but we could be in a much better position than we are. 

Our biggest issue is Jon's mental health problems which stem a lot from his environment. When he's in a productive environment when he can control the outcome he is rarely unhappy. He has about $4000 in the bank, we plan on buying a house soon so we can have our privacy. It's the next step he wants to take. We get into awful week-long arguments because he has no healthy outlets for his frustration. We may have a good day or two here and there but the last month or two has more or less been having as little contact as possible. We eat dinner together and can be in the same room, but he can barely look me in the eye most days. 

He wants me to get into counseling, but it's his firm belief he can't afford it. Intake in his area is $200-300, not including the ongoing biweekly or monthly sessions which will run another $100. It's his firm belief he's going to need 12-24 sessions to get himself right. 

That's not feasible or responsible when he has a family that needs a roof over their head and a car to get them around. His 4k is all he's got. There's no emergency fund if his car takes a shit. He still owes on his car so he can't just trade it in if that does happen. He can't get into counseling and still make sure we remain solvent. 

He feels like everyone blames him for not doing it and still feeling shitty all the time, but nobody seems to care why. Is he the asshole and just doesn't see it?""",1,Female,genderbent
"Last month, my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He's only 42 (kidney cancer under 45 is rare, so he definitely qualifies as a ""young"" case). Next week, he goes in for an operation where they'll cut out either a part of or all of one of his kidneys. After that, we'll try to figure out if it's spread at all and whether he'll also need further treatment like chemo or radiation.

Obviously, he's not in a good place mentally. He was having serious problems with sleep and work. It's terrifying. So he got some anti-anxiety medication to get him through the time until the operation. It dulls his terror and lets him sleep.

I told him I hate who he is when he takes it. He's apparently ""emotionless"" and ""cold"". He told me he doesn't want to stop taking it. It's only another week, and I just need to accept that this is something he absolutely needs right now. He says that I'm emotionally abandoning him and only thinking of myself instead of how all of this is affecting him as well. I get that this is hard on me too, and he can't offer me the support he normally would in hard times - but I just don't get how he doesn't realize this is harder on me. This is happening to him. He's going to go through a major surgery with a painful recovery period, and his life might never be the same. He might then have to go through treatment that will make him really sick, and even then he might just die at the end of it all.

He's still doing what he can to help me through this. He hasn't stopped doing his share of the housework, spending time with the kids, or any of that. He gives me hugs and kisses and reassures me it'll all be okay. But yes, I recognize the medication makes him less emotional. That's the point of it. It stops him from crying all night. It stops him from obsessing over his mortality and allows him to do those things. So while he might not be as emotionally present, at least he's still able to do them, right?

So, Am I The Asshole for telling him I don't want him to stop taking the anti-anxiety meds and prioritizing his own mental health?",0,Female,genderbent

"""Me (20m) and my girlfriend (20f) have been dating for about 5 years now and everything is great, except for my relationship with her family.

The issue is that they have political views that clash with my own. For example, they often use slurs, say the N word as a joke when referring to each other and call sex workers ""wh\*\*\*s"". They also believe that all poor people are just lazy, that trans women are only pretending so they can go into bathrooms and SA young girls, that women who are SAd often deserve it because they led the men on, that immigrants should be sent out of the country and/or shot etc. For further context, my family is also lower class New Zealand Maori and I'm bisexual, so a lot of the time their comments really sting.

They have also been casually racist to me on occasion, but I don't think there was ever any malicious intent behind it and they genuinely did not know that what they were saying was racist. They have also always been nice to my face. They invite me to all their events, engage me in conversation, and are just generally really kind to me.

However, I just can't seem to separate them from their political views and have started to take a disliking to them that's become quite obvious to everyone. I've been very short and curt when speaking, I refuse to see them or go to their house and if I'm there I mainly stay on my phone the entire time. It's gotten to a point where my coldness has made them quite upset and they've messaged me asking why I don't like them anymore. I told them that while I appreciate how nice they've always been to me, I don't think they're good people and are not compassionate towards others. This turned into a whole huge text chain where they attacked me for being rude and disrespecting their house when they've been perfectly nice to me for the past five years.

Until then, it will be in my guardianship and in case of my death, the guardianship will be transferred to his godparent(my best friend) or my lawyer no one except me, my son, and my lawyer can access the money within it.

Before we were together, he married at 24 to a woman named Grace, who sadly passed away 2 years later from a work accident. Mark was really affected by her death, of course, and he remained close to Grace's family in the years since.

Honestly, I have always felt second fiddle to Grace. He never wanted to get married to me, despite marriage being important to me, because he said he only ever planned on getting married once, and intends to keep that plan despite his wife dying. He still sees Grace's family regularly, and he is even part of their family Zoom calls, whereas he never seemed to give the same effort to know my parents.

Last week I went with him for the visit, and I noticed that he's been calling Grace's sister ""Auntie June"", and Grace's parents ""Mimi and Pop Pop"", which weirded me out because they are NOT my son's aunt or grandparents.

When we got home I told him that I don't want our son to be visiting them all the time, because it bothers me that they see my son as part of their family. Mark got mad at me, saying that since he's kind of their son-in-law, our son kind of is their grandson too.

Well, that got me really mad, as it just felt like one more way that Grace is still involved in his life, and that I'm just some kind of replacement. It bothers me that we have started a new life together, yet he is still clinging to his old life.

"TLDR - AITA for wanting to know if there's been a change of plans for my spouse's evening before/while it's happening?

Okay, my wife was out of town at a convention this past weekend and they have agreed to isolate away from everyone in the home for 4-5 days (I have an unvaccinated child). The event was vaccinated individuals only, wife was vaccinated in May, and also had covid about 3 weeks ago (hence the shortened quarantine). 
Wife works as a food delivery driver and didn't post a schedule for this week but instead can ""pick up"" shifts nightly (in case they do get sick this will keep them from having a call-out on their work record). Yesterday Wife left early to go hang out with Buddy before work. Wife was going in to work at 5, but didn't get to Buddy's place until just after 3 because of a previous appointment. When wife left I told her I loved her and that I hoped she had a good night at work, wife said thank you and went about her day. Wife returns home about 9:30-9:45 last night (normal time for them to return home from working) and I ask her how work went. She told me that she ended up not picking up a shift and hanging out with Buddy and Buddy's neighbor the whole evening. It was the first I'd heard of it and I'm not really sure how I feel because:
- It's not like wife and I could have spent any quality time together anyway because they are isolating away from myself and my kids.
- As long as they can pay their half of the bills the money thing isn't concerning to me.
- I was busy all afternoon anyway working on various projects around our home. 
- I wouldn't have said anything like ""No you can't hang out with Buddy"" because I'm not wife's dad and they are an adult with their own autonomy, but a quick text message would have been appreciated.
- Seriously just a quick ""I got over here late so I'm not working and am hanging out with Buddy instead"" just as an FYI would have been enough. I would have wished them a great evening and thought nothing more about it.

More explanation-
So, we've generally given each other an update of what's going on plan wise. We rely very heavily on transparency because we're also in an open relationship and without that transparency and lots of communication our relationship would suffer. I thought a lot about it before talking to my wife and asked if they would feel comfortable just shooting me a quick heads up when there's a schedule change like that. I also told them that I understood if they didn't want to do that and I would adjust and move forward. But that because historically we've always just given updates about what we're up to and if things change, it was a precedent that created an unspoken expectation. 
When we were talking about it they obviously got agitated (I asked before we even started the conversation whether they had the mental energy to talk) and kept asking what my reasoning was and where the line was as far as what they should report. When I would try and respond they would interrupt me and keep telling me I was not answering their question. 
After about 5-6 times being unable to finish a sentence they accused me of becoming angry and aggressive. I told them I was getting frustrated because they were interrupting me and they finally let me talk. 
I gave them the option to tell me it's something they didn't want to do, and we would move forward accordingly. Instead they said that when they shared their plans it was a ""gift"" of information they were choosing to share, accused me of trying to be controlling, and of letting my anxiety dictate the conversation. 

So, am I the asshole for asking my spouse if they felt comfortable sharing if plans changed as a sign of courtesy, respect, and transparency?",0,Male,genderbent
"""We (M30 and F39, together around 2 years) have both been under a lot of stress lately. 

On Wednesday, I started feeling really, really weird, due to prolonged stress and its consequences. I felt weak, fatigued, and dizzy, and was not sure how I would survive the day.

I asked my girlfriend if I could spend the night at her place since I was not feeling well and was not sure how I would manage the evening. I have fainted in random places a few times before, and one time it almost cost me my life (because I fainted in the middle of the street). I also get bad headaches from time to time.

When I texted my girlfriend this, her response was a bit cold and harsh. Instead of comforting me, she started questioning if I was actually feeling that bad and whether I really needed her assistance, etc.

She also added that if it is absolutely necessary, it's okay for me to go to her place but she won't be able to chat with me and that, in the near future, she will need more alone time than what she is getting now. Before this, she had not brought up this need, and on Tuesday, was more than happy to have sex and chat with me, etc. So I felt that her words came out of nowhere.

I got pissed off and revealed to her that I found her approach quite hurtful but will leave her alone and sleep at my place. However, we did not have a proper argument about this, just a few not-overtly-friendly words.

The next day, she did not send me anything, but I eventually had to ask her something. We had a short chat about mundane things and such.

Today, I was supposed to go and get something important at her place but felt too tired to go there and come back to my own place. Instead, I asked her if I could visit her place when she was on her training on Sunday.

She seemed confused and said that I did not have to go back to my own place but could have stayed at her place, etc. I told her that it does not feel like a good idea now.

Usually, we spend time together on weekends, so I know that by choosing this timing, we will avoid meeting each other altogether. 

However, now, after my anger has calmed down a bit, I am starting to wonder if I was too harsh on her. I found her response pretty hurtful, but perhaps I should try and be more mature about this. I do feel that I am punishing her, but at the same time, I feel like she is acting equally badly towards me.

"""I'm 37M married to my wife 36F. We have a 1-year-old.

She works full-time. I work part-time (remotely) and am enrolled in a graduate certificate program, so basically full-time hours. We are American expats living in a country where household help is affordable, so during the week we have a nanny/housekeeper 8 hours a day.

I have ADHD and struggle with focus, so it takes me a long time to get work done. Often I will be finishing up work or school projects in the evenings or on the weekends. When the nanny is here I am not always working or completing class work, I'm also getting groceries or doing other household tasks. 

My wife hates that I sometimes have to finish work in the evenings or on the weekend because it usually means she has to watch our son - although I try to do as much as I can while the baby sleeps. Her job is demanding, so she is often tired and she wants to sleep late and play video games and relax. Last week she asked me to ""promise"" to get all my work done during the week so that I'm free on the weekends. I said repeatedly that I don't like to make promises like that because circumstances can change from week to week and I might not always be able to keep my promise and also stay caught up with work and school. Like, our nanny could be out sick or something. She kept demanding that I promise and wouldn't let up, so I finally got exasperated and said, ""Fine!""

This week was a big national holiday in the country where we live, so our nanny was out Monday and Tuesday. I had to finish a school project on Sunday but I didn't do any work at all on Monday and Tuesday because it was family time. This meant that I fell a bit behind, so yesterday I was trying to show her all the work I still had to do and explaining that I would probably have to be working a bit this weekend in order to complete everything.

She was upset and disappointed and said that I broke my promise not to work on the weekends. I said that I shouldn't be held to that this week because I had only 3 days to do everything instead of the usual 5, and that she should understand that and be flexible. She said it's my responsibility to figure that out and not her problem. I also told her that I felt like it was unfair that she basically bullied me into making that promise and that I didn't want to make it in the first place.

"""My husband and I got married 4 years ago.  He had 2 kids from a previous relationship (now 8 & 10) that he has full custody of.  Their mom is not much of a figure in their lives.  I inherited my parents' house when they died about a decade ago and since my husband and his kids were living in an apartment, we decided it would be easiest if they moved into my house after we got married.  The kids now have their own rooms, there's a yard for them to play in, we got a dog, it's been really nice.

About a year ago, my husband's mom got sick and passed away.  It's been hard on a lot of his family members, but especially his dad.  A few months ago my husband brought up the idea of having his dad move in with us so that he wouldn't be alone.  I was very hesitant since his dad has his own health issues and adding another adult to the house changes the dynamics of the household completely.  

After a lot of discussion and pressure from my husband, I finally opened up to the idea, but there are still roadblocks.  The biggest being that we do not have a spare bedroom for FIL.  My husband's idea is to make the basement a kind of FIL suite.  However, I have spent the last decade turning the basement into my woman cave.  Think bar, pool table, poker table, big screen TVs, etc.  I did a lot of the work myself and I'm pretty proud of it.  

I told my husband that it's pretty much a non-starter for me to give up that space as it's something I've been working on for a long time, since before I even met him.  My solution is to have the kids go back to sharing a room and FIL gets the other bedroom.  My husband said that his kids have gotten used to having their own space and he won't force them to give that up.  

I asked him why it's ok for me to have to give up my space, but not anyone else?  I told him I am the one who is gaining nothing from having FIL move in.  FIL would get to be around family, my husband gets his dad close, kids get their grandpa, and I would have to give up something that I worked long and hard for?  Doesn't exactly sound like a sweet deal for me.

He called me a selfish asshole and told me I'm being ridiculous and stubborn.  He told me that this is now his house too and he's not going to make his kids sacrifice their space when we have a perfectly good space that FIL could use.  I told him that the basement is the one place in the house that I do not want changed, under any circumstances, no exceptions.

We've been fighting about this for weeks with neither of us willing to budge.  My husband is getting more and more hostile towards me and our relationship is suffering.  Do I just need to bite the bullet and give up my space?  I think I'm already giving up a lot by allowing FIL to move in with us, but am I being an asshole about this?""",0,Female,genderbent

I usually don't mind having them both over (we don't live together), but I asked her to leave the dog home for the night of my birthday since I don't have a large house and my family will be coming over and thus the situation will be hectic.

I am a bit uncomfortable with dogs since I feel responsible for the animal, and my GF's dog is notorious for snagging food. Other than that, the dog is really well-behaved, but when we're together, I always unconsciously watch the dog, which takes a lot of energy from me, as if I'm looking out for a child.
As I said, when we're at regular social gatherings or when we're seeing each other, I don't mind: I knew the dog was part of the relationship when we started.

I'm worried that I'll be too tired to celebrate my birthday properly when she comes over with the dog though. I'm an introvert, so bigger social gatherings are a slight challenge to begin with, and I'll have finished a full day of work before my family comes over to celebrate (they insisted they had to see me on the day itself, otherwise I would have moved it to a more convenient time and date).
On top of the fact that I am scared that the dog's presence will tire me out, it also weighs heavy on me that half of my family does NOT like dogs: I don't want them to be uncomfortable in my house when my partner brings her pet over.

I asked her if it was possible if she could find a sitter or a friend for that evening, but she looked very disappointed, saying that it would be a lot of trouble for her to find someone to watch the dog. She hoped that she could stay the night with me, and now that I don't want the dog around, she probably has to go home after a few hours. I said that that was fine, but she seemed extremely bummed about it.

"I am a short man (5’0) and my wife is a tall woman (6’8) who has back problems - so she likes EVERYTHING on the top shelf. Or on top of the cabinet itself

Obviously this bothers me since I literally cannot get what I need to get. And it’s not just the stuff she uses (since she doesn’t cook anything. I do all the cooking. And she doesn’t get any snacks or stuff out since I make her lunch for work).

So a few weeks ago I woke up when I heard her alarm - so that I could make her lunch before she went to work. As I was getting out the stuff, I try to mix it up so she doesn’t get bored of the same things. So I went to get her a snickers bar, but she put the candy bar box on the top of the cabinet, and long story short- as I was climbing up to get it (mistake in hindsight) I fell off, and broke my wrist trying to catch my fall.

My wife puts things up there because she has struggled with her back due to an injury that occurred at work. So she avoids bending over. And she refuses to get surgery to repair the disc. And I could’ve gotten something else to add ik its place for her lunch. But I didn’t. And broke my wrist falling down. It’s sort of my own fault, but I feel I’m justified in being upset.

I’ve told her not to, and I admit that it’s my fault. But I think her laughing at me was wrong. Especially since she just texted my brother to, “handle it”. grabbed her lunch and left. And then wondered why I was upset with her.

"New Story:
""
Throwaway for obvious reasons!

My wife is a cinnamon roll and just such a wonderful person. We’ve been inseparable since we started dating years ago and she’s my best friend. That’s why it makes me feel so horrible to think anything even remotely bad about her!

I guess I’ll dive right in:

The woman cannot hold a tune to save her life. I feel so guilty writing this but it’s true! When we were younger she wanted me to teach her how to sing and I tried but it just didn’t work and she got frustrated and stopped. She’s a little sensitive to any criticism or to not doing something good the first time. I’ve been in chorus at school, choir at church, and taken music lessons my entire life. She didn’t really even listen to music before we met. 

Still, if I sing then she joins in, and I don’t usually mind! It’s actually really fun! We are always together at home so we sing together often!

Recently I’ve been honing my vocal skills and recording myself singing. I’d like to upload to YT and SoundCloud someday. I’ve been too shy to try before but I think I’m decent enough to now. My wife has been nothing but supportive, which is why I feel so bad about the prospect of asking her not to join in whilst I record. 

Her feelings will for sure be hurt by this no matter how I ask…

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been unable to get a single good recording unless she’s at the store. Songs are usually 3 minutes and since my wife is always around me I can’t get thorough a whole song before she sings very loudly over me. I can hear her well from other rooms. She also sings mumbly because she doesn’t know all the words. It messes me up. I try really hard not to show my annoyance at this. I try not to even get annoyed at all but I do anyway and I’m sorry for it. 

WIBTA if I asked that she refrain from singing unless it’s outside of my little recording area? I don’t want to hurt her feelings… but I don’t want to give up recording either. I don’t know what to do.""

One day, the three of us were hanging out in her parents house. For a moment she had to leave and Lisa and I were talking, until he said something like “you know she’s only with you because I denied dating her, right?”. I was taken aback obviously and he kept on saying that she was in love with him since they were child and since he never felt the same, she decided to take me in as a filler but would never love me as much as she loved him. According to him, that is if she loved me at all, because she was all alone in another country, she was probably just desperate to connect with someone and I was the first one who stomped through her way.

Not gonna say that it fucking hurt. Day went on, when we were set to sleep I commented on what Lisa told me and she got shocked and absolutely furious. She denied everything he had said and comforted me the best she could, the next day she called him almost yelling and just excluded him from the tour he had reserved for us.

Before I left, I saw him once again because her parents invited him for dinner and he didn’t lose a chance there as well and completed saying that if it wasn’t true, “she wouldn't have been so bothered”. I said he was crazy.

Well, for some weeks, her parents came to see how her life was in here (my country). But, she ended up having some issues with the house she was renting here. She said she was going to stay for some days with her parents in a hotel and I invited her and her parents to stay with me and my family so they wouldn’t have to spend money. They were really thankful, but then she told me that Lisa was here as well. Turns out her parents invited him and another friend of hers which had family in another state so they could catch up.

I commented to her that I wasn’t comfortable being around him for another week, especially because I know that he might keep on saying stuff like that. She said that it wasn’t a problem at all and asked the other friend if he could stay with her family instead, she accepted. But, on the next day, I received a whole bunch of angry texts from him calling me a bitch and all its synonyms. He said that I was just in denial and that I should accept the truth and ditch her before she came into reality that I was just a whore who wasn’t worth her time. And said that once her change ends, she’ll dump me and find “some white guy who would be 100% better than me”.

Well, I don’t really think I am the asshole. Especially because he was clearly racist. But my girlfriend’s mother commented that it was actually unfair of me to separate them, since she came only to stay with her friend and now she is a state away. Her father agreed.

"New Story:
""For context I’m a Mexican man and my fiancée is a black woman. We’re both pretty young too. When I first met her sisters and her mother we all hit it off great, they love me and accept me like I’m their kin. When I met her oldest brother for the first time I thought it would be the same thing. My fiancée doesn’t get along super well with him but I still tried to be as polite and positive and respectful as possible. She was cordial but kind of curt when we first met but I assumed she just felt a little awkward. Come to find out, she thought I was kinda crazy because I was so peppy and high energy. I was told that after I went home. A couple weeks passed and I met her again at her mother’s house while hanging out with my fiancée. It seemed to go well until, once again, I found out otherwise. When I was there I noticed a $100 bill laying on the TV stand. I never touched it or even thought of taking it, but after I left she made a joke to my fiancée about how she’s glad it didn’t get stolen since “Ya know…” My fiancée told me straight away and made sure her family knew what had been said. But she never apologized to me and when she went back to her house (she lives in another state) her family threw a little going away party for her but I didn’t go because I don’t like her and I don’t want to be around someone who thinks that way about me. Turns out she apologized to her whole family, but never once apologized to me about what she said about me. She’s back visiting this week and I didn’t speak to her or address her when I saw her, but her mother and sister want me to forgive and forget and not hold grudges since she’s their family and I’m going to be too. I don’t forgive people without apologies because I believe in consequences for your actions. I told them I can’t make any promises and I left the get together not long after the conversation. They seemed upset about my answer. Should I just let it go without an apology?""",0,Male,genderbent
"""I(26F) had my birthday yesterday, before that being under a lot of work pressure I decided to get a bit drunk while talking to my boyfriend(25M) then I asked if we could talk later so I can carry on working after 12 am, due to being over certain deadlines at work. I currently live with my family since the pandemic and they all came to celebrate with me, I was quite tipsy but I talked to them for a bit before carrying on with the work. My boyfriend asked to let me know when I get free so that he can wish me. I intended to quickly finish some work and then talk to him, but I couldn't get away from my family and after a bit, I got really tired from working 12 hours a day and being drunk. I felt really guilty but asked my boyfriend if we could talk later and passed out since I was so tired I thought I couldn't manage to talk. My boyfriend got really upset the next day and he feels that I don't care about him and that he's not important enough for me and I love him only when it's convenient. He says my actions make him feel like caring is cringe. AITA here?""",1,Female,genderbent
"""On saturday I (22F) took my boyfriend ""T"" (20M) to meet my group of friends. We went to a bar, and I was happy to see everyone getting along. 

At some point I went to the bathroom and when I got back I saw that my friend ""M"" (23F) had taken my seat next to T. 

For info, I have untreated ADHD and started relying on nicotine at a young age to help me deal with it. T says he doesn't mind me smoking, but I avoid it when I'm with him seeing as he doesn't smoke himself, which in turn makes my hyperactivity unmanageable. But for some reason his presence feels really grounding to me, and I started to unconsciously reach towards him to keep my hands occupied. For example, I fiddle with his watch or play with his fingers and rings when I'm holding his hand. He picked up on it, but he encourages me to keep doing it. He sometimes gives me his hand when he notices me reaching for my pack of cigarettes. It's working well, but it means I'm almost always touching him when we're together. 

So back to the bar, I accused M in a playful tone of stealing my seat and he replied very seriously that ""that way you will stop having your hands all over T for two seconds. I know I was not the only one here feeling uncomfortable,"" which annoyed me because it's not like I had been making out or touching T inappropriately. I don't think playing with his jewelry would make anyone uncomfortable, which is really the only thing I had been doing. 

I told M that, and also explained that it's something we came up with together to help me with my ADHD. It turned into a full-blown argument after he replied that it's kinda weird to use my BF as a fidget toy and makes me look very possessive and dominant over him, even like I'm treating him as a pet. We went on for a moment while everyone else stayed silent, until I got too fed up with M and finally sat down at his previous seat at the other end of the table. 

The rest of the night was awful. I was all over the place, and couldn't resist smoking again. T had completely shut down. I wanted to get him away from there, so we left, fully aware that I was supposed to drive three of my friends (M included) back as well, but I couldn't care less at that point. 

Later on, T said that M made him feel self-conscious and humiliated, and that he also felt guilty for making everyone uncomfortable and being the cause of the argument. I told him that he did nothing wrong and apologized for putting him through that but he keeps blaming himself, which makes me blame myself. 

In my opinion, M was out of line, but maybe my way of coping with my hyperactivity is indeed inappropriate around other people or disrespectful of my BF. What I regret the most is reacting impulsively and causing a scene, putting T in a situation where he felt uneasy and then leaving instead of driving my friends home safely.

"""My girlfriend of one year has been staying over my house on the weekends since our relationship started. Recently, her laundry has been piling up at the house. Whenever I check the hamper, it’s mostly her clothes. I’ve asked her to take her dirty laundry home instead of leaving them here because I don’t want to do them anymore. 

She implied that I was a bad boyfriend for telling her to take the dirty clothes home, but I’m tired of being her personal laundromat. My water bill has gone up because she showers twice a day here too. 

She said this was the least that I could do because she helps out when she’s at the house. I only ask her to help me take out the trash bins weekly (and I go with her) and do the dishes (when it’s mostly her dishes in the sink!). Other than that, I do all the chores myself.

"BF (25) and I (25f) been together 8 years and last year spent our first Christmas together with his mum.

Both of our parents are divorced but naturally I assumed that we would spend this Christmas with my mum, especially as she has only just recently got divorced from my dad (a poor husband and father) and so did he.

Except he just told me that he has been thinking about this for 10 months and will most likely be in tears on Christmas day as a result of not being with his family.

I love Christmas and am used to seeing lots of different people at different times and it being no big deal but it seems to be very very important to him.

AITA for saying he's being a bit dramatic about it?

Feels slightly insulting to my family, especially after everything they have been through in recent history.

It's not like we wouldn't see his family either, it just might not be for the whole of Christmas Day.

He now won't talk to me about it and says I'm really uncaring and horrible.

"""I (28F) and my husband (28M) have been together 10 years, have been married for 2 years and have a 3 month old son.

A few days ago my husband told me that his cousin and cousin's wife started looking for beach houses in North Carolina and that some of his friends and extended family were thinking about getting the place during the summer of 2022. My husband showed immediate interest in this and I did not. He knew that I wasn't interested in going.

Today he showed me the beach house they want to get. His cousin's wife picked the house out. It is a massive house with a ton of features and amenities. We did not get any input on the location, type of house, features or amenities that we would be paying for.

I don't want to go though. There are a few reasons;

First, I was never asked what kind of vacation I'd like to go on and my husband kind of signed me up for this. My husband and I have gone on vacations to the beach with his family before and I haven't enjoyed myself any of those times, although this time we would be going with completely different people. I personally enjoy relaxing rather than finding a bunch of activities to do and going to tons of restaurants. I don't want to be dragged around to different activities and restaurants that I have no interest in. I have told him before that I won't go on any more family vacations due to bad experiences.

Second, we live in Ohio and this is easily an 11+ hour drive to North Carolina. My husband doesn't like to drive in places that he's unfamiliar with so I would be driving the entire time. When he's in high traffic areas he has panic attacks and gets scared. I've told him this and he insists that he would drive but in the end I will be the one driving because he doesn't like to. I have driven to ocean city with him for two previous family vacations and our trip has ended up being around 12 hours and it's a rough drive. I could barely keep my eyes open and was pounding energy drinks to stay awake.

Third, if my husband and I go then two more people would need to be added to the group to make the reservations $600 a person. So, this means that my husband and I would be paying $1200 (possibly more if someone backs out) just for a place to stay, not including any other expenses related to the vacation. In my opinion we would need around $2,000 total to have a comfortable vacation. We could swing this and it wouldn't be the dealbreaker but it's a lot of money.

When my husband showed me the listing I told him that I would look it over and think about it. He got upset and started crying and was in a bad mood the rest of the night.

I feel bad that he is upset but I was never involved in any vacation plans from the beginning.

Am I the asshole?

**Edit:** Well guys, it looks like I'm heading to NC next year. We had a discussion (more like a fight but whatever) and figured things out. There’s no way that I was going to let my husband drive with our 1 year old down to NC by himself. He also said that he's willing to get a hotel halfway there and back so I don't have to make the entire drive at once. We've agreed to both save up and that we won't be doing *every* activity with the group. We can go out to dinner a couple times, spend time to ourselves and relax. There are some places he'd like to maybe see because he went to NC as a kid and it would be fun to revisit them.

I think both of us overreacted. He promises to include me on future vacation from now on. I also told him what an ideal vacation would be for me, and that we can try to do that next year. He said this trip to NC doesn't have to be an every year thing.""",0,Female,genderbent

I was sitting and reading a book I knew she was on it but I didn't know what she was doing. She was taking pictures of me and a video of me too. She posted them on my social media and never told me. We were back at the house and I had my phone back and I saw the notifications. They were from likes and comments. I did not know it was from that until I looked. I was shocked and started to get really nervous and looked at them. I don't think I looked good in those. My face looks mean and I didn't know she was filming me so I had it like that.

"""I (m19) have a girlfriend (f27) that I've been dating for 5 months, we are long distance and it puts strain on the relationship. I like to call her all the time, but I plan it and make sure to stick to the plan. (I'm fine with plans being ruined if there's an emergency or family problem.) 

I asked my girlfriend on the 8th if we could talk on the 11th for a while, I had a tough week starting school again and missed her a lot. (Since we are both busy during the day, every 11th she spends some time with me since that's the day of the month we first started dating. It's important to me we at least spend some time together, so I always make sure I don't make plans.

She normally abides by this which I am grateful for. The call was set to start around 10:30 and she had been playing/watching her friend play video games all day which I was fine with, because she promised me the call. Amid my excitement and anticipation I received a text around 10 from her saying that the game ending was coming up so they were just going to keep playing and she'd call me when she got a chance. I was understandably disappointed by that but I figured I could wait a little while and then have my time. 

She told me it would be around 3 hours. I was very unhappy, because I had school. I couldn't stay up until 1 am just to wait and talk to her for 10 minutes. I told her that I was not happy with that and she told me that it was ""a situation she didn't have control over."" I asked her if she could stop, which was then when I was told that seeing her friend's reaction to the ending of a video game was ""super important"" and ""a once in a lifetime opportunity."" 

She almost dumped me because she couldn't handle that I was upset when she was ""clearly in the right"". I wound up staying up for her anyways to talk to her and clear it up. It was not only a time that I specifically requested to have with her, but also on a day that meant so much to me. I spent those three hours crying all alone just wondering if I really was valued less than a videogame. 

If she had told me a few hours in advance maybe I would have made plans around it. She told me that she was looking forward to the ending for a long while now and that she didn't just want to ask her friend to stop playing and resume later, which is understandable. 

The fact that hurts me the most when I think about it is that every time it gets brought up she says ""it wasn't in my control"" which yes, timing wasn't in her control, but she acts like the whole situation couldn't have been helped and that it was 100% out of her control, like she was forced to stay and watch. 

I tried not to hold it over her head that she did something that made me really upset. She promised it was a 1 time situation, however I can't help but trust her less over this and feel like I'm worth less than a videogame. She still gets mad at me for holding my ground and not taking her side.

I just want to know if I should be worried about what she did or if I'm overreacting and should apologize. AITA?""",0,Male,genderbent
"Ok, I know this sounds trivial but I am a little bit upset and don’t know if I should be apologizing or standing my ground. My 24F girlfriend just moved in with me (37M). Things have been going OK aside from the occasional bickering.

She has a ton of clothes. When she moved in, she moved everything in with garbage bags and laundry baskets. The last 2 weeks or so I had spent hours doing her laundry, folding, hanging stuff up. I just can’t keep up. There’s too much and it’s too unorganized. I have one washer and one dryer. She will leave clothes in the dryer for days (not sure if she expects me to fold them or what). Well I had to wash my clothes. They had been in the wash maybe 15 hours and clothes get a weird smell if they sit too long. I work during the day, so I didn’t really have time to fold my girlfriend's laundry; I just moved the clothes from the dryer to the bed so I could put my clothes in the dryer.

She lost it on me and said you can’t fold clothes when they’re cold, as in not fresh out of the dryer and that I wasn’t doing her any favors moving it and that she’d never do that to me. Basically said she would have to rewash everything (not sure why). Well of course she’d never do that to me because I remove my clothes once they’re done but that’s beside the point.

AITA for taking her clothes out of the dryer and not folding them? I feel like I might be. On the other hand, I work full time and do most of the cleaning and cooking and I feel it’s not fair she just expected me to fold all her clothes or just wait however many days it would take her to do it before doing my own laundry.",0,Male,genderbent
"""I think my girlfriend is codependent because her last relationship was very abusive with a narcissist, emotionally unstable man who she financially supported for years. They recently split before we met. She bends over backwards for people and sees it as her lot in life to take care of others, which is wonderful and kind, but I'm scared she's going to be taken advantage of.

Her narc ex invited a couple to live for next to nothing on their property in an RV. The couple still lives there even though the ex is gone. They are young, the guy doesn't work, and the girl is only employed part-time. She is always in the house using the kitchen. She comes and goes from the house as she pleases.

I tried to make friends with him when I first started spending more time at the house because he seemed cool. Quickly I came to realize he is someone who is very emotional, has no boundaries, and causes drama. He is exhausting to have around, and I'm beginning to feel like they are using my girlfriend. They are basically living there for free. When I asked my girlfriend about it, she says she feels protective of the guy and doesn't want to turn him out homeless. I understand that, but they have the RV, and I think he has options if he looks for them. I think she's being used and enabling their lifestyle because she's not asking them to pay rent.

To add, her dog is terrified of them and freaks out whenever they come into the house, even though they've lived there almost 2 years. In contrast, her dog loves me and doesn't bark even when I'm at the door, and has never growled or snapped at me. We play and cuddle all the time. I trust the dog's instincts, but my girlfriend says she thinks her dog is just neurotic for no reason. To me, it sounds like maybe the couple is using her house when she's not home.

I’m on mobile and absolutely reeling, so apologies for any formatting or grammar errors. For context we are both about 20, and we’re heterosexual.

Me and my partner are polyamorous, under the agreement that we acquire the others consent before entering any other partnership. We do not share partners, and are each other’s “anchor” couple, with plans for moving in together and marrying and having children. We are long distance, but only about 10 hours drive, so we see each other about bimonthly. 

Last year, I was the first to ask about dating another person, my close friend who goes to college with me. My partner said yes, but seemed uncomfortable. I asked him if he was actually okay with it, and he said no, not until he moves in with me, so I have respected that to this day and continue a completely platonic friendship to this day. 

Recently, he expressed to me that he had feelings for one of his friends. I wanted to be petty and say no, because it felt hypocritical, but I understood my reasoning was petty, and I love my partner. I want him to be happy more than I want to be a dick about being perfectly fair because I dont feel fairness and keeping score is good for a relationship. I told him yes, and tried to get to know the person as a friend (at my boyfriend's request). I meant the yes. I take no issue with this scenario, it’s just context. 

Skip to tonight. I go in our friend group chat and he’s made a cute, flirty powerpoint asking a friend out who I know of vaguely, but he hasn’t brought them up to me recently, and never mentioned having feelings or wanting to pursue them. I found out by reading the presentation. It hurt, I’m not gonna lie. I texted him and asked a few questions, and told him I was angry. I didnt name-call or threaten to leave, just made sure he was aware I was not okay with this. But it slowly started to sink in, I considered this cheating. I know it’s dubious and gray area, but to me I felt used and cheated on as a “safety net” or “base”, since he’s the financial breadwinner and pays for everything we do. So I told him that what he did was cheat, and I needed some space. He’s texting me constantly, and he’s told other people he’s going to harm himself. I feel so guilty ignoring him, but I just cant deal with sorting this out right now. So I’m just ignoring him (dick move, I know, but it’s been 1-2 hours at most since I found out).

"""Not sure if this is necessary, but TW for eating disorder.


I (31M) was looking through an old set of photos with my gf (37F) when a picture of me from 5ish years ago came up. She told me I looked really good in the picture. I let her know that during that time period I was struggling with an eating disorder and literally not eating. She said again, ""well, you look really good."" I told her again that I wasn't eating during that time and that I don't really care if I looked good because I was being super unhealthy and it wasn't safe. Basically that I'll never look like that again because I'm never going to stop eating like that again. Again she tells me, ""well, you looked really good. Just accept the compliment.""

That's when I get defensive and snapped a bit. I said that's really fucked up that you keep telling me how good I looked in that picture when I'm explaining to you that it's only because I WAS NOT EATING. She doubled down so I said a couple times ""that's fucked up dude"" in kind of an aggressive tone.

She snapped back and told me that she didn't want to be attacked like that for giving me a compliment and that I should just accept the compliment. She said she wouldn't be able to keep dating me if I was gonna attack her and snap on her like that, especially when she was just trying to compliment me. So I apologized and tried to walk it back.

Bit of context, my gf is attracted to me now without a doubt. I'm healthy and happy and she's always going on about how much she likes my body and stuff and we have a healthy sex life. This old picture wasn't wildly different from how I look now, maybe 10 lbs less and much tanner. It just rubbed me the wrong way how she wanted to double down on my appearance instead of showing empathy for what I was going through.

I realize I could have been calmer about it and explained my feelings better before jumping straight to being defensive and angry.

I feel like he wants to be like one of those tiktok couples seeing that he’s always following and searching pages like that. Personally, I’m not very fond of watching random self absorbed teenagers who like looking at themselves make unfunny videos and in no way wish to partake in any of those trends.

You know I don’t like doing tiktoks babe please don’t get make me do it” long story short we got into a little dispute over it and he’s pretty upset at the moment. He ended it with “fine you don’t have to be in any of my tiktoks at all.” That one really upset me because why did me not wanting to do a tiktok dance translate to me not being in any at all. After a few minutes of explaining why I didn’t feel that was an appropriate answer and seeing he’s not getting it I kinda just tuned out and stopped talking to avoid escalation since I was getting progressively more and more irritable. I plan on apologizing later for having such a repulsive action with the “fuck no” cause he claims I was rude about it, but besides that I really don’t think I’m being an ass hole to the point that’s worth him being genuinely upset with me. Am I the ass hole? I really don’t think I should feel like avoiding his attitude is the only good reason to do those little dances with him when I really don’t want to do them to begin with.

"""So my S.O.’s dad is sick and I’ve offered to help with keeping his house clean since he’s supposed to be resting, which is what I’ve been doing. Today, I offered to go through the fridge and throw out old food to make room for new groceries and food that his dad (my S.O.’s grandpa) brings to him. 

It was a god awful mess in there. At least half of the non-liquid items were either mouldy or straight-up rotting in their containers, and I ended up having to throw out about 10lbs of old food. Some of the food had expired MONTHS ago, and the smell of the decaying food alone was enough to make me want to vomit. 

I disposed of the food and went to my S.O.‘s room to take a quick snooze, since I have a habit of taking short naps to deal with stress (and I wanted to stop smelling that godawful smell of rotting food since I was borderline dry heaving when in the kitchen) I had left the dishes/containers the food was in in the sink, and I’d submerged them in soap water and was planning to give them a more thorough cleaning when I woke up.

Unfortunately, when I was sleeping, my S.O.’s dad went downstairs and saw the sink of dishes. He’s kind of a neat freak so he got upset at my S.O. and I and didn’t even thank us for cleaning out the fridge. I tried explaining the situation and he completely ignored me. So now I’m wondering if I should’ve just sucked it up and dealt with the dishes right then and there. 

TL;DR I offered to help clean old food from the fridge because my S.O.‘s dad is sick. There were 10lbs of mouldy/rotting food that I had to toss, and I took a break because if I stayed around the smell for any longer then I would’ve puked. My S.O.’s dad saw the food containers (during said break) I was going to wash later soaking in the sink and got mad that my S.O. and I didn’t finish the cleaning job in one go, despite me telling him about how the mouldy food almost made me puke. AITA?

EDIT: I see some people asking how he can be a neat freak with a fridge full of decaying food. He has this “not my problem if I can’t see it” mentality. For instance, he can’t see inside the oven, so he ignored the grease pool at the bottom of it, but if my S.O. leaves homework papers on the dining table where he can see it when he walks by, he’ll get upset and tell him to clean it up.""",0,Male,genderbent

Going to try and make this as short as possible. Essentially I’ve been having some trouble at work and an unknown issue has gone to HR. I’m a physician so this is a big deal to me. My boss claims not to know what the issue is and says that she’s trying to figure out which complaint went to HR. She said she sent a bunch of emails today to find out the root cause of the problem. I have no idea what the issue is and it’s been causing me a lot of anxiety. I can’t even fathom. So today while I was at work I stayed very much so to myself haven’t texted anybody and have been focusing on just getting my work done and getting out of there. I rounded with my patients, spoke to case managers, updated families and finished my notes. I text my girlfriend this afternoon saying “I am so stressed out and depressed, I can’t today.” She responds back saying “Why??? Wtf is going on with you 
And if you’re so depressed I find it weird you haven’t even wanted to talk to me all day about it. Like who are you venting to???” I felt like that was such an inappropriate response to the statement I had made and I got really upset and told her “you need to stop making everything about you I’ve been really stressed out I’ve just been trying to get my work done and get out of here. I spent all night talking to you about it, what more am I going to vent about when I don’t know what’s going on?!” And sent her a screenshot of my outgoing messages which were all to hospital staff/nurses/other doctors. She responded “wow you’re so condescending. you totally missed the mark. It’s fine” This seems like kind of a pattern with her I’ve decided to find a new job and I can tell from the tone of her messages in our conversations that she’s not very happy about me possibly having a new schedule again about her because our schedules will no longer coincide if and this is a big if I took a new job and it’s not even necessarily that our schedules would not overlap it’s very possible that they still could overlap depending on where I choose to work and what schedules I choose to work. Am I overreacting?

"Since my husband can't say no we are driving 2 states over to meet my brother-in-law and give him a puppy. One that he wanted and purchased from a breeder in my state. I expected him to pay for the hotel room but this morning my husband asked me to book not just ours but theirs as well. This did not go over well with me. I told him that he doesn't see how his agreeing to do this without my input has impacted my day/weekend and now we have to be out money for their room. In my mind, paying for our room is the least he could do since we're utilizing our gas money, my vacation time at work, and our miles on the car to bring him a dog. This has been a point of contention between me and my husband all day. My husband doesn't see it this way. He said families just do and don't expect. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would be offering to pay for everything if someone was going so out of the way for me. To add a cherry on top, I was supposed to go see a concert tonight but had to cancel since my husband couldn't be here to watch the dog due to his work.

"This is my first post and I am on mobile so obligatory apologies for the formatting.

I am a 21(M) with a partner a year younger than me in college. I know they have a hard home life with an incredibly strict grandmother who makes them feel awful all the time. They are also suffering from depression and I try my absolute hardest to be there for them and listen to them. I let them vent to me and try to emotionally support them as best as I can. I also have major anxiety and depression, and recently one of my family members who I am super close to has a serious medical condition which put them in the hospital. When they got out I became their full time caretaker for a while, they were so weak I had to literally pick them up and place them in a wheelchair and place them on the toilet whenever they had to go to the bathroom. I had to wake up every hour and thirty minutes to check on them at night and usually maybe got an hour to three hours of sleep a night. I told my s/o this and the most my partner ever said was that they were sorry and they wish they could help. Then they immediately started becoming upset, complaining about their college work and how tired they were. I became upset, I know that their feelings aren’t invalid and try to remind myself of that. But my s/o willingly stayed up at night all night to play video games and talk to their friends. I always ask my s/o how they are feeling, and they never ask unless it is a follow up to what I asked. I feel like they only care about their own problems and it hurts. I did vent to them once but my s/o seemed really disinterested. I feel upset at them lately even though they haven’t technically done anything to upset me. Am I in the wrong here for not being as supportive as I can be?",0,Male,genderbent

"Hey everyone. I am 26(f) and I recently broke up with my boyfriend, Lisa, of two years. Lisa had approached me telling me he wasn't happy in the relationship and wanted to work on it more, but nothing I ever did seemed good enough, and it began to feel like I was ""working"" all the time. On top of that, he was flirting with a classmate a lot, which made me feel uncomfortable tbh.

The issue is, Lisa is in his last semester of college and broke. He doesn't work, his family is unable to help, and the school he attends is already having a housing issue, so they can't help until the next semester, which is in late January. Two weeks ago, I gave him the thirty days' notice required, and he blew up.

He thinks he can live on campus next semester but asks that I allow him to have the extra room, but I really don't want that. The relationship is over, and I no longer feel responsible for him, but if he moves out, he will have to withdraw from his classes, which will push his graduation back, and he would lose all of the money paid.

"""I always do the laundry, but last week he didn’t wash any of my uniforms. But he did wash everything in our hamper. So if they were in the hamper they would have gotten washed. But they weren’t. 

He leaves earlier than me, so he got ready, made me some oatmeal, let it cool (so I could eat as soon as I woke up) - while he made up my lunch and stuck it in the fridge. Left my Aderall out for me, woke me up, and left.

I texted him wondering where my uniforms were. He said he didn’t know. I then called him wondering why they hadn’t been washed. He said he washed everything in the basket. I got all upset and said he was being passive-aggressive but not doing it to, “send a message”. But I genuinely didn’t wash them originally because they weren’t in the basket.

Now - truth be told, after he had washed our clothes - he did find it odd that they weren’t in there. And found them in a corner in our closet. There are 2. But I have 1 good one. He admittedly left it there. And he does feel bad. It was dusty. But he personally believes I could’ve worn them if I really wanted to. But I instead called in. And then blew up at him when he got home.

This was last weekend. And I got mad on Monday. But I didn’t post it cause it was the week and I was a little busy. So I just waited til the weekend.

"""I(M31), my wife ""D""(F31) and sons(""K"" 12y and ""J"" 9wks) are currently in a hotel while waiting for our new house to be ready, we're all in one room as a result. ""D"" is on leave from work as a result of the move, so she's home all day. 

Now 70% of her day is currently spent playing XBOX/computer games which isn't a big deal, there's no housework currently, K is in school, J is still in the newborn stage so he sleeps quite a bit during the day BUT - he's up most of the night after 1am. I'm his sole caretaker at night, I'm running on about 2hrs of sleep a day. 

D was having some beers and playing XBOX (it's worth noting here, when she plays she's on with our mutual friend and has headphones on, her voice is obviously still audible to myself/kids especially after a couple beers when she thinks she's more quiet than she actually is) and at about 10 when K laid down I asked her to keep it down so K could sleep. Shortly after, I got J down and asked D to PLEASE be quiet because the boys were both in bed and I was trying to go to sleep myself. 1am rolls around and I've been asking every half hour for her to keep it down (something she kept complaining to our friend about but like...do it and I wouldn't keep asking?), she's woken K up several times and I've yet to fall asleep at all so I'm coming across pretty btchy at this point. I got up and moved the earpiece so she could hear and told D she was ""being a selfish ass and a shitty wife and mother"" and she just looked at me before shutting everything down and getting in bed without saying anything.

I feel like I may be TA because she rarely has downtime from work and she is currently stressed because of the new position she'll be a part of so I understand her playing is an attempt to destress as well as ""hang out"" with our friend who lives in our home state, plus I think I genuinely hurt her by saying what I said. I'm not one to insult her, she's a wonderful partner who is great with our boys, but I still said what I said to her and it felt true in regards to the moment/situation.""",0,Male,genderbent

"""My ex and I got together over 3 years ago, moved into his house after a year.

He has two children from a previous relationship. We also have a child together who is now almost a year old.

&#x200B;

We mutually decided to break up a few weeks ago. I have my reasons, and he has his, but ultimately his kids play a big role in the break up. Not their fault, it's more about our different parenting styles. Due to my trauma from when I was a child and the kids' bio mother emotionally abused all 3, I had a protective bubble around them that was a massive source of conflict. He could write a list, but he doesn't see how it would be beneficial to this.

&#x200B;

Anyways, we broke up because we didn't want to resent each other for our child's sake. Like the way he resents his other kid's mother. They have been staying here until he finds a new place. However, he keeps making remarks about how I'm going to struggle on my own, especially when I have our daughter half the time. I've left it be because I'm pretty sure he is projecting, he will no doubt struggle. But it is also the damn time. I was having a particularly bad day at work and he knows, and he brought up how I'm going to cope with work and our daughter.

&#x200B;

My life would be easier when they move out.

Yes, I will be having our daughter 3 nights/4 days a week, I changed my work pattern so when I do have her I don't have to work. So I have no issues there.

Looking after our daughter will be a breeze, I have no issues now looking after her. In fact, I make sure I have her more than her father because I love spending time with her. And it will be even easier when he and his kids move out for so many reasons. The biggest is that all 3 cannot help themselves and always have to disturb our daughter when she is trying to sleep, so she then doesn't sleep and gets cranky and whines until I take her to my mother's so I can put her to sleep in peace. All 3 are extremely messy, my entire house is a minefield and it stresses me out to no end, and none of them clean up after themselves. I also find myself doing more for his kids than he does, I always take them to school and pick them up, take them to their after-school activities. Make sure they are fed and shower often as otherwise he wouldn't remember. I also pay for everything related to the house. We only split shopping and petrol.

&#x200B;

So I told him that when they move out I will have more money to save. Because I will be spending less on bills, and this is after me paying more than I should in child support. My house will be back to being clean and tidy, that will reduce my constant stress. Looking after our daughter will be less stressful because I will be able to put patterns in place to help. I will have more free time because I'm not spending it cleaning up all their mess, running around all day for his kids when it is his job.

My life will finally be back in my hands. He didn't take it too well and has been quiet ever since.""",0,Female,genderbent
"Girlfriend caused a minor scene and threw up at my small birthday party. I asked about being aware to stop before getting to that point and was told I was being controlling.

Ok, so here we go. My (M27) gf (F28) enjoys drinking when she is able to (she does not drink on weekdays/before work). She may have an occasionally beer on a Thursday, but for the most part, it’s a weekend thing. However, when there is an event (party, social gathering, etc) she tends to overdo it. I personally am not the biggest fan of alcohol (I will have a drink or two) so I normally will DD if anything. In part, I think part of the issue is that a lot of her friends egg her to keep drinking (ultimately it is her choice though) and it’s just led to headaches for me. She has left the gas grill outside on one for hours (I found it by chance because I brought my dog out), she is very clumsy and falls on me, or she just gets very loud and confrontational.

The main incident: I was having a small group (six people including my gf and I) over for my birthday party. The week of my party, my gf got a new job and was super happy. We were at a day drink party earlier in the day (we were invited to this AFTER I had planned my party but I wanted her to be able to see her friends as well).

Nothing eventful happened, but we left and went back to set up for my party. I guess I didn’t account for her earlier drinks, but she got VERY drunk. She threw a plastic coke bottle on the ground and was acting like a child and wouldn’t pick it up. We ended up also having an argument about the amount of movies we have seen in a trilogy (it turns out I was wrong and did apologize the day after). Ultimately, she disappeared and my friends were asking where she was. I went to the bedroom and saw she was passed out on the bed. I went back to sit with my friends and as it got late, some people left. I was in the bathroom when I heard her throwing up. I went to the bedroom and saw she threw up all over herself and on my side of the bed. I was frustrated, but just had her strip and dealt with it on my own. I still had friends over and honestly, it was very embarrassing to have to deal with this in front of them.

The next morning I asked my gf what she remembered. She didn’t even remember throwing up on herself. I brought up her behavior and such and her defense was that she wanted to celebrate her new job. I said how I'm proud of her new job, but this was supposed to be something for me and I had to end up taking care of her. I suggested that in the future, we stop drinking when we reach our limit and she responded that I was being controlling. So, Reddit, AITA for being controlling?",0,Male,genderbent
"""Hello reddit, my son is 2 weeks old. I have barely held him since he was born. My husband constantly has him. When I do get to hold him, my husband just starts crying hysterically until I give him back. I asked him why and he said he was anxious that something would happen to our son and that's why he felt the need to hold him so close.

No matter how much I tried to reassure him, he just wouldn't let up. I practically begged him just to let me hold him so that my husband could shower, eat, and care for himself but nothing worked. I felt like I was losing precious bonding time with my son so I did what I thought I had to do. My husband fell asleep on the sofa with our child, I took him, went to the guest bedroom and locked the door.

My husband woke up shortly after, very upset of course that our son wasn't with him. He soon realized I was in the guest room and begged me to open the door. He was crying, kicking, and screaming. I didn't open it though, and spent a good couple hours with our son in there.

Apparently my husband had called his dad, because I got a call from my fil cussing me out, saying how I shouldn't be taking a newborn from his postpartum mother and other things like that.

My M,29 wife F,33 recently got kicked out of her job and she decided to sue her former boss for misjudgment. She's been feeling upset ever since. She really worked hard to get her possessions and seeing years of work go to waste was devastating for her.

Her friends have been taking her out to cheer up and let off some steam. The problem is that she'd be gone for hours and show up late at night drunk. 

She did it 2 times this week. She came home at 2am while drunk and made noise because she expected me to open the door for her when I was asleep. I couldn't wait for her and stay up late because unlike her I have work and other responsibilities. When she complained about how I should be quick to open the door for her, I told her that next time she comes home late like 2am and up, then I won't be opening the door for her. Period. She said she won't stay out late again and that my ""challenge"" was accepted. 

Last night she went out with her friend who dropped her off outside at 2:30am. I was awake at the time when my wife kept ringing the bell then knocking on the door. I remained in bed and refused to open the door. She called my phone telling me she was outside and I needed to open up. I asked her to tell me what time it was and she said ""it's 7:30! It's still early, come on open the door!"" It was obvious she was drunk. I said I won't open the door for her after I already warned her and told her I was going back to bed then hung up. She kept calling over and over then knocked several times on the door then she stopped. Turns out she slept in the garage on the floor. She had a huge argument with me, calling me petty and ridiculous for keeping her out and refusing to open the door for her. I reminded her that I didn't have to stay up every week to wait for her and open the door for her.

"New Story:

Sorry for my bad English. 

The incident happened last Sunday and we have barely spoken since.

I am 26 and my girlfriend is 29 years old if that matters. 

So her parents gifted us both a visit to the climbing forest 2 hours away. It was supposed to be a nice Sunday but gf was in a bad mood the whole day. I asked her what was wrong, she said I was 5 minutes late (we didn't have any pressure regarding the time), so I guess she was just in a bad mood without a reason. 

So the day was quite fun, we made the parcours together and are doing good. When we made a break to drink some water gf took her phone with, which is strictly forbidden in the climbing forest. 

I told her I don't want her to do that but she did it anyway. I also told her I don't want any trouble here since I wanna have one nice day apart from learning for a scary exam I have in a week. I also told her to not make pictures of me. I don't want pictures there. She tends to secretly take pictures of me in special moments which I utterly dislike. And we talked about that topic before, she knows I don't like it.

Just to make clear: I like taking pictures and we take pictures a lot, I just don't want pictures taken without my knowing.

So we did the last parcour which was the toughest one. I was behind due to one obstacle I haven't managed right then. Gf was a couple platforms before me, which were going in a corner. From there she took a (assuming) video of me trying to manage this obstacle. I was trying like 10 minutes when I noticed her. I shouted to her to stop. She laughed and kept filming. I shouted an 'Are you dumb? ' to her, then I noticed there was a man in the platform under her and I didn't want the man to think I meant him (we chatted casually before). So I shouted 'Gf is filming me and isn't stopping!'. They were both like ten meters away from me, so I needed to shout to speak to them, but also not to far for her to take a video, she got the latest Iphone from her work.

Then an employee noticed us. He shouted to my girlfriend that she is not allowed to finish the parcour and she is expelled from the climbing forest (which was not thaaaaat bad, because the parcour was our last and there were only a few more platforms left). The employee also asked me if I had a phone with me, I said no. Girlfriend climbed down to the ground and waited for me. I finished the parcour, which was nice. Then we went back to the car and drove home without talking. When we arrived to the house she lives in I asked her if she wanted money for the fuel and if she wanted to come up to my flat. She said I broke her trust today and she needs time. I didn't say anything after that.

I don't think I am in the wrong but she haven't really spoken to me since. So AITA?


UPDATE:

Thank you so much for commenting. I really appreciated that. Nobody asked for an update, but I will do it anyway:

Since the incident we barely talked. A friend of mine told that last friday she RSVP'd no to her party which is in than two weeks. I assume she already made her decision then. Today we talked via phone because I insist of a mediator and not going alone to her. She didn't want that.

So she told me that since this day she couldn't trust me and therefore we don't match, so she wanna break up. No sorry. She said she didn't know I didnt want to make pictures and that I should have endured that and later should have told me to delete this pics (and it were pics according to her). She also said I talked to the employee when I actually talked to the man under her. I told her that even i snitched she already knew I didn't wanna have pictures, so what's the matter?

Anyway, since this day nothing is like before. I personally think there is someone in her mind or someone put a bee in her bonnet. I don't understand anything she said. My friend and her boyfriend will take my stuff from her. I insisted they to it together so it will be OK. And I good of mine comes soon with ice cream.

To sum up, I guess when she took pictures of me and i said I didnt it and she took it anyway (yeah, that happened a lot) she always thought I was OK with it, since I didn't oppose it. I need to be more mindful of that one I guess. More adamant of what I want.",0,Male,genderbent
"""So last night my (17m) boyfriend was violently sick with some sort of stomach bug. He hadn't eaten all day because he couldn't keep any food down at all and on top of this he had just started his period which didn't help with the pain.

After not eating all day he couldn't go to bed as now his stomach hurt from hunger as well as period pains and the illness. He was crying from the pain (not something he does often as he's not a very sensitive guy) so I knew it was bad. I suggested he eat something slowly to avoid throwing it back up and to help with at least one of his pains.

Fast forward 30 minutes later it all came back up while he was sleeping. He managed to sit up but wasn't fast enough to get to the bucket to the side of the bed and so it went on the sheets. No big deal as we could just change them and go back to bed.

The spare sheets were in the airing cupboard just along the landing. Bare in mind this house was built in 1950s and not much had been done to it since so a lot of the floor boards under the carpet were loose. If you stepped on it it would make a loud creaking noise so being stealthy wasn't exactly an option at 4am.

Now here's where the problem comes, over the last few years his father has become a heavy drinker and smoker, not being able to go to bed without having at least 3 cans and when he isn't working will start drinking at around 1pm. He works at a Lidl and chooses to work night/early shifts as he ""hates customers"" and so he will get up around 3am to then go to work at 6am. Bare in mind the store offers totally flexible hours so he doesn't have to work as early as he does.

He constantly complains about how early he gets up and likes to bring it up in every argument he has. I can't ever tell him what I think of him as I'm paying rent and he likes to use it against me.

At the time I didn't know I had woken him up as he never says anything until its too late to fix.

Later that day he gets drunk again after work and started shouting that we woke him up. I explained that I'm sorry for waking him up but I'm not sleeping in a bed full of sick. To this he replies ""its not good enough you woke me up and I have to get up early for work""; totally disregarding that his son is sick and that we had no other choice and he continues arguing about it and starts slamming doors.

In my opinion this is completely selfish and arrogant behavior and not to mention quite childish for a 45 year old man, but then again I'm living under his roof (paying rent of course) and should abide by his rules and cater for all his needs as he is the main provider of the household.

So, Am I the asshole?""

"My wife is great. And I love many many things about her. But I don't love all the d-jokes she makes.. We were at my sister's and her fiancé's apartment meeting her for the first time.

And she proceeds to look at her fiancé and ask whether she wants to hear the story of how we met. Her fiancé says yes. She says well it's a long story. Then pauses. Before adding, ""but not as long as my D-"". Then began laughing hysterically while everyone else (myself included) just looked confused.

And when we got in the car I let her know how I feel. I just couldn't take it anymore. I've told her about it. But she still does it. I mean she repeats the jokes so much that my 7-year-old son has began repeating them in class according to his teacher.

She got quiet in the car. And didn't respond. Then when we got home she asked if I was embarrassed of her. I said I was when she made those types of jokes. And long story short: she's decided she'll be sleeping in the guest room for, ""the foreseeable future"".",0,Male,genderbent
"""She stays at my place 4/5 nights a week and leaves her clothes everywhere, doesn’t clean dishes, make the bed, or throw away empty water bottles. Basically doesn’t help tidy up at all.

My girlfriend went out and bought food and prepared it for us tonight. We had a good evening, then when it came time to do the dishes, I did a few and asked her to do the rest. She got really upset. She asked me if I was serious a few times. She said in her culture the men do the dishes and chat with the women and it’s no big deal. She offered to do them tomorrow. She was very offended I asked her to do the dishes.

My apartment building has a roach problem. I keep my apartment clean so that I don’t entice them in, and have preventative measures against them. I never leave dishes in the sink or food it overnight. I explained this to her, why they needed to be done tonight. I offered a draw- when you cook I clean. When I cook you clean. I proceeded to wash. She insisted on starting them- I went in the other room feeling uncomfortable with the tension and she came out in her regular clothes (she was in her pajamas before) and started putting her laptop and iPad in her suitcase.

She said she was leaving. She left. I called and she didn’t pick up. I texted and thanked her for picking up and preparing the food. She said it was a good night and thanks. That’s it. AITA?""",0,Male,genderbent
"*AITA for telling my ex that I didn’t wanna do things with HER father?* (Had to edit title) 

My ex fiancée (40F) and I (30M) were looking for an apartment. We went to see one that honestly, I didn’t like so I told her that we should keep looking. She tried to convince me to get that apartment and after a few days of thinking, I agreed. I even imagined how everything would look like and by the end of the week I was very happy with the apartment. The landlord texted her and asked her if we wanted the apartment. She said to me that she should ask her dad and if he said yes, it was a divine intervention and the confirmation that we should do it.

I had to ask why she needed to have her father's permission to get the apartment even though I already had agreed to go for it AFTER she begged me to do it? Like why did she have to ask him if she was going to be living with me, not him? And most importantly, why my opinion didn’t matter? Like, if he says yes we take it, if he says no, we keep looking and I don’t have any saying. I felt so disrespected.

Then one day I was going to the spa and I told her that I wanted to go with her. She was happy about it and suddenly asked me if I would go to the spa with her father? I said yes, just not every time. She got pissed! And the same thing happened when I told her that I wanted to go to a museum and we should go on a road trip since the museum was in another town. She said “yeah, let’s take my dad” and I was like ??? WHY DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE HIM IN EVERY PLAN?

Don’t get me wrong, I had a good relationship with him but I wanted to spend time just with her, in our newlyweds phase. I told her that I didn’t want to include him in everything we do and of course, it was a huge argument and she got really mad.

"
Growing up was rough for my bf/fiancé. Before we started dating I was in the Army and saved everything I gained and placed it into income streams. When my fiancé and I started dating he was still kind of scraping by in life unaware of his investment's rising and we moved in together after 8 months together and a little later accidentally had a daughter. Now the issue, its been several years later now and money has gotten better but we still keep our finances separate while maintaining most of our life decisions with each other's say in the matter. He had some HUGE major winfalls in his life in the span of 4 years through investments and his landscaping side work was good even through 2020. He's been wanting to make some power moves to improve our lives but it's been a massive point of tension between us. One conflict is he's been investing into the silver market and I'm not happy with him buying it up. I've been on his case thinking he's being frivolous with his spending even though he's aware this isn't even a tiny dent on his money. Another point of tension is him and his best friend have been discussing real estate investment work for housing but I've been trying to convince him to hold back and put it into savings. One of our biggest arguments was when he invested 60k to a buddy of his to fund his mining operation and development projects. When I found out about it listening to him and his lawyer drawing up the contract in the living room, I was furious. I accused him of just risking everything in our future without even talking to me or not giving a damn about our future as well if it suddenly goes up in flames, which spurred an argument over his money. He feels like a jerk when he snapped at me telling me it didn't matter because it was his money he's putting in and we have quite a few backup sources of income in case things went south. Another fallout we had was when he was trying to invest in his first rental property too. He doesn't really want to talk to me about it because it is his money in the end and his risk. He doesn't want me to take the fall in case he screws up. I think he's leaving me out because he doesn't want to have a life with me, which isn't the case at all. He wants to give our daughter and me a good life. Things get tense when the idea of money is brought up and he's been passive-aggressive about it. If I ask what he wants for dinner, he tells me I can decide for myself. He's tried to ease me abit by having a joint account I can access, but it doesn't seem to help at all. He doesn't feel like he's wrong because he's trying to do this with our future lives in mind, however, this has had our friends and some family members on both sides divided with some saying it is his money and others saying he's a jerk because it would be a nasty surprise if anything were to go wrong and my say should matter too in his personal investments. Even his lawyer is split and all he can say is that at least the two of us are not married.",1,Female,genderbent
"So my girlfriend and I are two gay women (for whatever that's worth 🤷). My gf has a habit of springing the fact that she's going to see her friends, let's call them Tina and Tiffany. Tina and Tiffany live about 5 minutes down the road from us. And they're great people, I have no problems with them. However, everytime she wants to see them she goes to their house, which is fine. Problem is Tina and Tiffany drink a lot. So my gf almost always needs a designated driver. I have no issue being the DD either. My issue is that everytime she goes over there it's a weekday, and I work 9-5 Mon-Fri and I am not a morning person at all. I need my sleep. But the problem is not that she goes to see her friends, she could stay out till 2am and I wouldn't bat an eye. Seriously I'm not the gal who gets mad if my gf wants to spend a night out a few times a week, in fact I enjoy my alone time. 
My problem is she'll go over to Tina and Tiffany's and tell me last minute. Then she asks me for a ride. Both of which are okay with me. But what's not okay, is I'll call her and ask ""Are you ready to come home? Or do you want to stay out later?"" Either is fine. But she'll say she wants to come home. So I say ""Okay I'll be there to pick you up in 5-10 minutes."" Once I get there I'll call her and tell her to come to the car to go. But almost every time I call her from the driveway she insists I come in for a drink. Often I tell her that I don't want to, or that I'm tired and want to go home to get some rest, or that I don't want to hang out and I came to specifically pick her up and go home. But she insists and keeps pushing, and I don't want Tina and Tiffany to think I don't like them and Idk if I'm on speaker or if they can hear me. So I go inside and without fail it turns into a 2-3 hour hang out session. She ignores all of my signals and gestures that it's time to go and I'm kind if sick of it. 
I don't mind hanging out if it's planned a day or even a few hours in advance. And I don't care how long she hangs out with her friends. But it's annoying being ambushed into hanging out for 2 or more hours and then I also get the pleasure of having to remain sober while they all drink. So would I be the asshole if I told her I'm not going to be her DD anymore?
Also I've spoken to her about this more than once.",0,Female,genderbent
"Hi guys,

So, I (Female, 20 years old) went to the post office to pay my visa fees. At the time, I was wearing sport shorts, a normal T-Shirt, and flip flops. After finishing my stuff with the post office, my boyfriend (also 20 years old) texted me and asked me to pick him up at his house. I said yes and I would be there. When I arrived, I texted him and waited outside to say that I was there. Then, he told me to come in, but when I came in, he immediately said my clothes weren't polite and he said that his mom didn't want to see me in shorts in his house and idk maybe jokingly said that I should go out to buy pants then come back inside. At that point, I just didn't know what to say and it was really awkward because he said I wasn't polite for wearing that. Meanwhile, whenever I meet his mom or his dad, I always say hi with a big smile on my face. His mom is friendly, she smiles back. But his dad never says anything to me. However, things got more serious as he kept telling me to dress nicer when going out, even without him. I told him that the weather was very hot and my pants didn't fit me because I gained weight during the pandemic (73kg to 80kg) and that I would feel uncomfortable when I keep forcing my stomach in. I also told him that it's alright because I didn't plan to go to his house anyways. But it leads into a fight about my politeness to his dad, that his dad didn't want to see that and my clothes weren't polite enough. In overall, I just feel like I'm being disrespectful to someone without doing it, and I feel like he is just trying to save his face because my clothes weren't polite enough...",0,Female,genderbent
"Some background: Years ago I used to enjoy going away for the weekend and exploring new areas. Over the past handful of years that’s largely been put on hold because my girlfriend won’t travel anywhere without the dog. Her dog has had some health issues and she is too worried about him to spend the night away from him and she doesn’t have anyone she trusts to watch the dog beside me. So we can only do cabin trips and road trips in dog friendly areas. 
Recently, I’ve been in a rut. I’ve been working from home since Covid and have been feeling very secluded and burnt out. I have recently been saying I feel like I’m lacking some guy friends in my life. Then out of the blue, a friend from college invites me on a short boys trip! It was like the universe handed me what I asked for. 
My girlfriend was super hurt and betrayed when I told her because she was under the impression that we were going to go to that specific location together one day in the future. She claims we discussed this and it was something she really wanted us to do together eventually since neither of us have been. I don’t remember this conversation- I do recall I begged to go there for one of my birthdays but she wouldn’t budge with her no traveling without the dog rule and said one day in the future we would go. I didn’t know that meant it was off limits in the meantime.  
She thinks it’s wrong of me to want to go and said it was a betrayal. I am hurt because I would support her 100% if she went on a girls trip regardless of location and I feel that it was blown out of proportion because a boys trip is completely different than a couples trip, even at the same location.",0,Male,genderbent
"""I’ve been selling online foot content since I was 18. I met my ex at 22, and was upfront and honest. She said that it wasn’t a deal breaker since I planned to stop after I got my Master’s degree.


Fast forward to 25, I get pregnant and we have a baby, so I put finishing my degree on hold for a year. Then COVID hit a few months before I finish my degree, and she loses her job. I tell her that I think I should keep selling content until she can get another job, and then once we’re more stable, she'll get a career in her field. She agrees and admits she was going to ask but didn’t want me to feel pressured. Some months I make over $6k, so we have a huge savings and even manage to get a second car. She’s struggling to find a job, but I’m making enough, so it’s fine.


One of her friends subbed to me (I didn’t know who it was), and she became my biggest tipper. My ex finds out and deletes all my content off my computer and camera, and deleted all my profiles. I didn’t know and started freaking out, crying, trying to find numbers to call to restore them, etc. Then she tells me she told a friend about my site, and that friend has paid $2k+ in the last three months on me. We get into a huge fight because she’s still not working, and now I have to start all over again. We lose our second car after six months since now I’m lucky to make $3k. Our savings are gone because she keeps stealing from me. We end up fighting again and I leave her after she blames me for her deleting everything.


She runs and tells all her family that she found out I was a SWer and left me, and she needs their help to get our baby back. Her family starts bombarding me, calling me names, and basically saying they’ll make it so someone as disgusting as me can't ever see my baby again. After a few months of this, I just release screenshots dating back to 2018 of her talking about my ManyVids and other sites I used to sell on. Her family FREAKS out, and now she’s disowned.


Personally, I think that it’s her fault. My family is aware of what I do, and so are my friends. They respect that it’s work and have nothing to do with it. She told her friends, some of whom she knows have hit on me, and deleted the way that I was keeping us clothed and fed when she couldn’t work out of jealousy, then told her family a lie that I could prove was false. But her friends and some mutuals think that I could have explained without being so blunt with the screenshots. I feel bad her family won’t speak to her because they feel used, but I don’t think it’s my fault.


Also, I literally sell feet stuff, and the most I do is bra and panties. I could see her being jealous if I was doing traditional SW, but I wasn’t.

Edit: I just realized this might be relevant, but I never kept her from seeing our baby. She’s literally never contacted me or came to my new place (even though I let her know the address) to see either of us. She just immediately went to her family with her fake sob story. She also refused to sign the birth certificate AND refused a paternity test because she said she didn’t want to ""be stuck paying child support"". I know I should have dipped then but I was iN lOvE

"""I (M25, Asian) have been with my fiance (F27, White) for over a year now. Her dad has been overbearing since day one, for example the first time I met him he asked me if I am “pleasing his daughter enough sexually” and wanted to know how many times/week I am making her finish. He also always calls her sexy and asks her to touch her arms or abs (which she doesn’t think is weird) but that’s a story for a different day. i just want readers to understand the kinds of things he says out loud. He has lately (the past two months) been more hostile toward me whenever we are around him saying that I am “getting in the way of his relationship with his daughter” and that I need to “let her be alone with him more.” My fiance tells him that she wants to spend time with me when she’s not working so he can either see both of us or neither of us. This last time we saw him, we were eating dinner at his house with his new wife and my fiances brothers when out of nowhere he said “I hope your children look only like their mom.” This was out of nowhere but that’s how he always is. I said, “well we aren’t going to be having kids anytime soon so you don’t need to worry about that” to which he replied “well I don’t want biracial grandkids because they’re always so ugly when features are mixed together like that.” Everyone got quiet and I didn’t even know what to say. Eventually he got up and offered everyone dessert. Soon after we left and in the car I expressed to my fiance that I was hurt by what he said and the fact that she didn’t stand up for me. She said she didn’t want to hurt his feelings and that he didn’t mean it to be hurtful. I told her that if we do have children that he will never be able to see them or be around them because I don’t want our future kids to be around someone like that. She’s mad at me now and keeps telling me that I need to see things from his perspective and that it’s unfair that I would put her in a position like that by not letting him see our kids one day.

But finally it all got to be overwhelming, and I said I would be happier, if we could rehome the dog. Normally, I wouldn’t want to do such a thing, but I didn’t want the dog in the first place and she got it for me without asking. And the dog is expensive! I’m spending upwards of $500 a month.

""Context: There are hats that are exclusive and sold like a stock exchange. One person can buy a hat then sell it again for the price that they want to sell it for which means price can drastically change over time.

I made this account in 2011 where I had put birthday money into it (Over $400 at the time). I bought multiple hats and other gear that substantially grew to over $1500 in robux by 2018.

In 2018 I had gotten myself a boyfriend, (18yo male) (I was 17 yo female). Whose brother was 10 at the time. So trying to be a good girlfriend I lended him my account. (He loves Roblox). I requested he not touch my belongings and he could play whatever he wanted.

Couple weeks later I see that he had sold a hat worth $600 and spent all of the $600 of robux onto one game giving him virtually nothing. 

As time went on the other gear I had remaining were still in my account and remain untouched. Which are still worth around $1300.

From 2018-2021 the little brother has put around $150-200 of birthday money over the years into the account.

2 weeks ago my boyfriend of 3 years has broken it off with me to pursue another person from his university. It was out of nowhere and somewhat shocking.

So with that being said, a week ago I took my account back in plans to sell the account with the remaining items because I am a 20 year old college student and could use the money. So I changed the password.

She’s also quite a busy person with a lot of friends so my messages get lost in all hers and she doesn’t look through them for me so I’ll have to message her on multiple platforms sometimes to get a response, which makes me a little sad. 

I started using text, and let her know I’d like her to use it too. She’s been not reading my messages I sent her on there so let her know I’d like her to maybe pin me, I have her pinned, and that it would help her remember. I told her I like being able to look back on messages that make me smile and it’s a better platform for me. 

She flat out refused, said I should know “text annoys her” and says she’s not gonna do it. I let her know that I’m asking her to do it, that it would be nice for me if she could. She still refused.

"""Background: my partner (F46) and I (M31) have been together for 8 years, and have been engaged now for 3, we had a big wedding planned pre-pandemic and understandably postponed it twice because of lockdown restrictions.

After the second postponement, my Mother (F55) passed away suddenly and we postponed again because I was broken. My Mom's family fell out with us (me and my sibling) when my mom died over funeral plans, inheritance issues - they basically wanted to ignore my Mom, my sibling, and my wishes and do what they want - so in terms of family, it is just me and my sibling now (dad passed in 2014).

My partner's family started hassling us about the wedding because restrictions are pretty much gone, everyone in our circle is vaxxed and can travel (partner's family from another country). My partner and I paid for and will pay for everything, so it's not like my family has a financial stake here. I am really struggling with the idea of getting married without my Mom or my family there. When our Dad died, my sister and I both had severe depression, and our Mom (who just lost her husband) picked us up and carried us through (we were 22 and 24 at the time, so independent adults), I can't stress enough how incredible a woman and mother my Mom was, and how shattering losing her so young has been. A big attraction to the wedding for me was dreams of her walking me down the aisle and making an embarrassing speech, I can't picture a big wedding without my Mom. My partner is completely fine with waiting so it's not an issue between us.

Future FIL and BIL were on Zoom with us and brought up the wedding again, looking for an update on when we were having it. I shrugged and said we weren't thinking about that just yet. BIL exploded and said it wasn't fair for me to hold my partner to ransom because of my ""mommy issues"" and that they deserved a wedding after spending so long in lockdown. Partner gently said he isn't being held to ransom and is fine with waiting, we've been together 8 years, a ring on the finger isn't a big deal. FIL said that if we didn't pick a date to hold the wedding next year in the next week, then he had no intention of coming, and BIL agreed. I removed myself from the situation and heard my partner arguing with them.

My partner and I decided to cancel the wedding, and we let everyone know by sending out cards. We lost a lot of money as most things had been paid for already. FIL and BIL are furious and not speaking to either of us. It wasn't worth it to us to have a wedding with none of my family, and his family being completely disrespectful to us.

"""I (29F) met some old friends from Law School and mentioned that I started dating this awesome new guy. When they asked me what he does for a living, I panicked and said he was a doctor, but he’s actually a cleaning man at the local high school. I feel bad for lying, but at the same time they’re all doing pretty well in life, dating other lawyers, doctors, models, etc. The thing is that if I would have told them he’s a cleaning man, they would have look down on me, and wouldn’t invite me to networking events anymore.

One of them invited us to a party a few days ago and I didn't tell my bf about the lie I told. People kept asking him to check their moles, which he did. On the way back home, he told me how weird people were and I told him that I told my friends that he was a doctor. Now he’s pissed and won’t talk to me anymore. I get that he’s mad, but I was trying to protect him too. Knowing them, they would have probably made fun of him or straight up ignored him. Am I the asshole here?""",1,Female,genderbent
"Some context: Me (24F) and my BF (26M) have been dating for 2 years, and moved in together 3 months ago. My BF (and both of his parents) are native english speakers, and my BF doesn't have any sort of learning disability.

Onto the issue. My BF just finished college, got his first ‘real’ job, and we moved in together. I think all of the extra time we now spend due to living with each other has made me sensitive to the issue: My BF chronically mispronounces and misuses words. It seems that anytime he learns/hears a new word, he’s eager to use it, but more often than not, is not pronouncing the word correctly (and many times, is not even using the word properly). I’ll be honest and admit that it bothers me (although I am not quite sure why).

I will preface this by saying that when I do correct him, I make sure it is in private. I have never corrected him in front of his friends or his family. I will mention, however, that I have noticed looks on people’s faces when he clearly misuses a word, but most people are too polite to mention it.

I’ll give a brief example of each. The other day, my BF must have picked up the word ‘perpetual’ somewhere. He must have heard the word used in the context of “never ending” or “a lot”, so when I asked him if the car needed gas, he said “I just filled it, so it’s perpetual.” I was confused, and thought he said something about petrol? Once I understood what he was trying to say, I showed him the word on an online dictionary, and he was upset because he thinks I made him look stupid. I said that learning new words is great, but if you aren’t 100% sure what it means, make sure to look it up before you start using it. He acted a bit huffy so I dropped it.

My BF and I both work from home, and often in the same room. On a call with his coworker, I kept hearing him say “pro-pie-itary” instead of “propRietary.” After the call, I let him know he had been saying the word incorrectly.

This made him quite upset, and he asked why I kept pointing it out and making him feel stupid. I told him that he needs to google words if he doesn't understand them, and while I may be the person pointing it out to him, I told him I am certainly NOT the only person who notices when he does this.

This led to a big fight, in which I told him that I will no longer correct him, but feel that this habit will eventually negatively impact his professional life if he doesn't start looking up these words.",0,Female,genderbent
"edit; if you’re just going to leave a comment about how i’m getting married too young, please save it. that's not what im on here asking about. and not that it really is anyones business on here, but we aren't getting married anytime soon. we got engaged to prove our loyalty, and we aren’t having a wedding for a few years.

So for reference, I (19M) am newly engaged to my fiancée (20F). Before getting engaged, we have been together around 3 years. With getting engaged and from me living in a VERY toxic environment, my fiancée’s dad offered for me to start staying with them rent-free, which i am still super grateful for. I even offered to pay some type of rent, take care of certain chores, watch the animals while they are busy, etc. but they declined all offers.

I’ve been staying here since July, (it is currently October while posting this), and everyday for dinner, they will let me know its done after they all sat down and ate.

At first, when they did this, I thought it was accidental, since they weren’t used to me living here yet; but its been months and they still continue to do this. They make dinner, they all sit down and eat as a family, and then will call upstairs and let me know dinner is done. By that time, the food is cold and most times put away in the fridge, while my fiancée’s mom, stepmom, and grandma all are making their way back to their rooms. It makes me feel left out and excluded, and also makes me feel like they don’t want me there.

My fiancée is barely around for dinner anymore because of college, but i still decided to talk to her about maybe bringing it up to someone that i would like to be included more, since i’m living here now and in the process of becoming part of the family. and to make clear; i brought this idea of talking to someone up as a possibility.

However, my fiancée said i was overreacting about being excluded and i’m being an asshole for assuming her family is like that and doesn’t want me around. She says if they didn’t want me around, they wouldn’t have offered me a place to stay. I agreed with her, but still asked if she could mention about doing more so i can FEEL more included, by doing things such as inviting me to sit w/ them and have dinner together sometimes.

She told me to stop pushing, that im really just being an ah and overreacting; and to let it go.

i did shut up about it, and now im sitting alone in the other room wondering if i really am just being an overreactive ah. my fiancée doesn’t want to talk to me until i apologize for assuming such a thing about her family.

also some background; I asked her to talk to her family about it rather than me simply because i’m not confrontational and she likes/prefers when i talk with her about whatever first before talking to her family anyways.",0,Male,genderbent
"Me (18F) and my boyfriend (17M) have been together for 11 months now ,and I have tried and usually succeeded at seeing him every weekend. About a month ago I had a car accident that totaled my car (I had no injuries besides a small cut on my hand) and have been unable to purchase a new one. Due to circumstances where my grandparents are my neighbors and that I work nights my grandpa has allowed me to use his car to get to and from work and to use occasionally on the weekends until I get a new car. This makes me feel horrible even though I fill it with gas because I feel like I shouldn’t have to rely on others, so I try to avoid using it more than necessary while still seeing my boyfriend on the weekends (who lives an hour away and can’t drive). Well last weekend my boyfriend's birthday was Friday, so I went to spend time with him Friday and Saturday and when he asked for me to go see him that Sunday, I said it felt disrespectful to take the car all day for 3 days straight and so he reluctantly agreed I didn’t have to go as long as I went this upcoming Sunday. Fast forward to last night while I was working, he told me he had family photos Sunday that he forgot about and then told me I had to be at his house 2 hours earlier than planned to pick him up and take him to the place where the photos are being taken (another hour away from my house) because his dad's car would be full. I refused, saying he can’t expect me to drive 2 hours when I don’t even have a car just to watch him get his photo taken with his family. He has now been telling me that he got his hopes up about seeing me and me saying I won’t go has caused him to cry and that he would do it for me.

"""My wife wants to lose weight, and she’s constantly talking about how she’s struggling. She specifically wants to lose her, “woman boobs”. And although I tell her it isn’t true she’s right that she’s lost at least a little weight all over, but her chest

Now I did get irritated by her refusal to actually exercise or eat healthier. While simultaneously wondering why the pounds aren’t melting off.

So I made her a healthier lunch for work (no candy or other sweets). And she said I was, “fat shaming” her. But I was just trying to help her.

I told her she could eat what was in there, or make her own lunch. And she changed her tune. All this is to say that I have helped her. And continue too.

Now for the main conflict that led to the post:

She didn’t want to go to the gym before since she thought, “people would judge her”. But she’s slimmed down a little bit. She has been eating healthier, walking and (unsuccessfully) trying yoga with me. And she says she wants to go to the gym now, but only if I’ll go with her.

The thing is - I also am not super interested in gyms. She’s not interested cause she doesn’t want people staring.

I am not interested because I’m more than satisfied with my figure, and don’t want to sweat it off. I suppose I could do squats or something. I’m just not really interested in (possibly) losing my hips and chest - and just looking like a boy, or getting all sweaty.

But I feel bad since I know this means a lot to her.""",0,Male,genderbent
"""Background information: my little sister “Ava” (12) has an eating disorder causing her to be severely underweight. 

⚠️SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH!! I am Norwegian so I am still learning. ⚠️

I (18f) have been dating my man (18m) for 10 months. I took him to meet my family a little under a month ago. Everything was going great but he looks at Ava a lot. I think nothing of it since it's common to stare at her. Everything was great until it was time to drive him home. He started saying that Ava looks “inhuman” and she needed to “just eat more.” 

I tell him that it's not easy gaining weight or losing weight while having eating disorders. I also tell him not to say such things about her. I say this with an angry tone I suppose. He takes my explanation as insults and doesn’t talk to me for the rest of the car ride. So when we reach his home, he leaves the car without a goodbye…just silent.

The next day I feel so bad about my behavior in the car so I text him an apology for it. He responds with forgiveness and we go about our day. I give him snacks when I see him in person. I felt so very sick about my actions.

Since I made my man mad, AITA?""",0,Female,genderbent
"A bit of backstory. I (23m) am on the autism spectrum, and one of the things I struggle with is food aversion. A lot of ingredients most find absolutely delicious and amazing, I find downright repulsive and vile, mostly because of their texture. It gets bad enough that I involuntarily gag if I force myself to eat it. Most people always just think I'm picky and disregard my food aversion, and because of that, I absolutely hate it when people surprise me by having lunch ubered to my workplace. Because each time they do it, it's something that mainly consists of something I'm averse to.

Today, my partner (27f) decided to say she's going to surprise me by having lunch delivered for me. I asked her not to and that I'm fine, but she was adamant and placed the order anyways, without running what she was getting by me. This made me anxious of course, because I'm worried it's going to end up being something I can't stomach. 

It got delivered. It was a personal pizza. But when the delivery guy handed it over I could immediately smell one of my averse ingredients through the closed box, and I immediately knew which pizza she had ordered. A bbq chicken supreme. Bbq sauce, chicken, onions and... *green bell pepper*. I cannot stand anything of bell peppers, especially the green ones. The texture cooked and raw is icky and green peppers just taste like water and chlorophyll to me, and that taste tends to cling to everything it touches. And what's worse, this pizza place absolutely loves covering their pizzas in green pepper when it's ordered, so picking it off is nearly impossible. It would just be easier to take a knife and scrape the entire thing of toppings off, y'know, the cheese, chicken... everything. 

I let her know thanks for the food and she ended up asking me if something was wrong and if the food was okay. I was honest with her and said that she had ordered one with green peppers and sadly it's not something I eat. I then told her I appreciate the gesture but that I'm sorry and that I was probably just going to give it to a colleague that wanted it or simply toss it if nobody wanted it. She got upset because she thought it was the kind I liked, and I told her I just enjoy the plain bbq chicken version and not the supreme one, and that this is why I hate people ordering food for me. Now she's upset and very cold to me.

AITA for saying that?

Edit:

So a few minutes after posting, my partner got back to me. She had thought she'd ordered the correct flavor of pizza that I like, but our local variant of ubereats has decided to put both options right next to each other, with the Supreme cut off on the one. She ended up tapping on the wrong one and didn't double check before checkout, and she was upset with herself for making that mistake. She's feeling better now after I told her it's nothing to be upset over and we've all made that kind of mistake before. Thank you all for your responses!",0,Male,genderbent
"""My(22F) husband(26M) has been eating all of the food I make everyday since he got me pregnant a month ago. I tried making enough for him and me. However, I'd come home to no food because he'd eat my portions too. I tried making double portions but he'd then snack on that and finish that as well. I tried ordering food for both of us after coming home(which I usually don't because I'm vegan and vegan takeout is quite expensive where I live) but he'd still eat my food as well as his food.

I was getting more and more irritated so I added nuts in my portions and marked the container with ""CONTAINS NUTS"" in bold. I kept my nuts containing food in the mini fridge in my room.

I made food enough for 3 meals for him with no nuts and kept that separate in the fridge in the kitchen area. He's allergic to nuts so he didn't eat my portions after seeing ""contains nuts"" written on the container.

I finally came home to some food I could eat. He was mad at me because I used his food aversion to stop him from eating my portions.

AITA?

PS: we sleep in different rooms because I roll a lot while asleep and since he's pregnant we did not want any accidental injuries.

Edit: I've tried talking to him about his eating up all of my food but he just says that I should be a woman and suck it up, that he's eating for two now and it's my responsibility to keep him fed.

Edit 2: I also add mushrooms alternatively to the nuts since he hates the smell and texture of mushrooms""",0,Female,genderbent
"For clarification, we both work in the music scene and drug use is definitely prevalent but I made it clear from the get go that I was totally against it and she had been clean since before we met. We've been together 3 years but only married 2 months, and have a baby (7mo). My wife has never done drugs aside from the occasional marijuana since we've been together, before we met however she did have a serious problem.

My wife is a musician and I work in the business side as an agent, but also just running shows. My wife is in a band with very close friends of hers that she's been in since before we met. She is also in a band with a more successful musician friend of mine who gave her a chance once we were married.

Tonight was her first show back with her first band and it was sold out. They were opening for a bigger band who happened to be managed by my personal hero, a huge agent. I told her that playing in front of him was a big deal, this is the biggest show of their career as if he likes her band and signs them they no longer need a day job. In retrospect, probably shouldn't have mentioned it as this really psyched out her and her friends and made them super anxious for the show.

Onto the important part, I attended the show with 2 friends of mine. I was super excited for it and set up a babysitter in advance as she had a show the next day with the other band (my friend). I usually go to shows early but since I was going with friends I told her to go ahead and went at the regular time.

I am NOT a drug user. I never have and I have no friends who are. I saw nothing odd with every member of her band taking simultaneous trips to the bathroom before their set. During their first song I mostly watched my wife but also the other. I turned to my friends and said, ""correct me if I'm wrong but do they not look like they're on drugs?"" He assured me they 100% were as they were doing weird things with their mouths and tongues, making odd faces. HOWEVER I was only referring to the other members as my wife wasn't making these faces, and I didn't care if the other members were doing drugs as it is not my business.

They played the best set of their lives. After the set I greeted my wife, told her it was amazing, she did so well. We were flirting and kissing backstage beforehand and I was in such a good mood and so happy with her for playing so well. However, I then asked her, ""are so and so on drugs?"" She told me yes with a big grin and that she was as well.

I was furious my stomach dropped, I called the friend I mentioned before to drive her car home BECAUSE SHE DROVE and we live almost an hour away AND HAD TO PICK UP THE BABY. She had 3 beers too. I told her to give me her keys and find her own way home.

My friend came. At one point we were outside figuring it out and my wife kept trying to add things, I said to her, ""stop looking for her for support is my friend not yours. Go away."" It was mean it really put her in her place. So AITA?",0,Male,genderbent
"""Hey there! Maybe it is not the most interesting post on here but I’m having (W20) some problems with my bf (M18). In our 1.5years long relationship we had really many arguments connected with me not remembering what he said earlier etc. He would mention that he had something to do and then I’d forget it and he would be really angry for that and say that I don’t care about him. Now I’m studying in a city far away from him and yesterday I met with a few friends. He had a breakdown because his grandpa who previously has beaten cancer has all the symptoms which say that it has returned. Also the same day his father had an accident and my bf said that he could have broken his ribs. The same evening I called my bf on face time, we talked for some time. I tried to cheer him up but it didn’t work. Today I called him in the morning and everything was okay. But suddenly he started complaining that I don’t care about him because I hadn’t asked him what’s going on with his dad etc. That I don’t understand how he feels about the situation with his grandpa (My relationship with my family is not the best) and that I'm not even trying to help him. It’s so annoying. We talk with each other at least 3hrs a day, I feel like almost everything we talk about is connected with his problems, never with mine. And than he gets angry because I don’t remember something he said and I don’t ask if he found a solution for his problem. Okay, this case with his dad is quite imporant and I messed up a bit but other situations far less important than this one are just making me angry. Now we hadn’t spoken with each other for a few hours and tomorrow we are having a date. Should I try to talk about how I feel about it or is it better to say sorry and try to remember everything the next time.""",0,Female,genderbent
